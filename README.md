Because **Codoku** is a fully interactive, logic-driven game rather than a static content site, this section plays a more prominent role than it did in other project types ([Milestone Project 1](https://github.com/TeseoLou/clancy-nook-walking-tours)). Interactivity is not just a feature of Codoku, it's the foundation. These functional elements power the game experience, define progression and reward, and ensure the site meets the goals of accessibility, replayability, and mental stimulation.

Functional requirements were derived from user stories, accessibility considerations, and the emerging UX components. They are categorized here by their level of scope:

- **Macro Functions**: Site-wide behaviors and foundations (e.g., responsiveness, accessibility)
- **Meso Functions**: Features spanning multiple areas of the game/app (e.g., navigation, stats tracking)
- **Micro Functions**: Focused behaviors tied to specific game elements (e.g., number input, square validation)

These core features served as a structured development blueprint, ensuring **Codoku's** MVP delivered essential gameplay, accessibility, and visual consistency‚Äîwhile leaving room for feature growth in future iterations.

## **2.3. Structure**

The Structure Plane defines how **Codoku‚Äôs** content, features, and interactions are arranged to support ease of use and logical flow. It connects strategic goals with the interface‚Äôs layout, ensuring that players‚Äîregardless of age, ability, or device‚Äîcan navigate and play comfortably.

As a game-based application, **Codoku** prioritizes interaction design over dense content. Key features like the grid, number inputs, validation tools, and timers are placed for intuitive access, with real-time feedback to reduce frustration and aid progression.

Navigation remains simple but purposeful. A top nav bar provides quick access to the Home, About, and Rules pages, while the footer offers consistent links to external platforms like `GitHub` and the donation page.

The layout includes:
- An interactive Sudoku grid
- Touch/mouse-friendly number buttons
- Difficulty and timer selectors
- Clue and check buttons
- Feedback messages and modals

Information is structured to minimize distractions and cognitive load, with semantic `HTML` and `ARIA` support for screen readers. Elements are grouped by function and follow consistent patterns to support user familiarity.

**Codoku‚Äôs** responsive structure adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile, using scalable fonts, high-contrast visuals, and keyboard-friendly controls. Altogether, this creates an inclusive, focused space that enhances logic-based engagement and replayability.

### **2.3.1 MoSCoW Prioritization**

Throughout the project, effective prioritization according to business goals, user needs, and developer capabilities was crucial. With the project scoped to deliver a complete, accessible Sudoku game interface within a limited timeframe, it became essential to continually assess what was realistic and achievable based on available time, technical complexity, and learning goals.

To support this, the **MoSCoW** prioritization framework was used to categorize tasks into **Must-Have**, **Should-Have**, **Could-Have**, and eventually, **Won‚Äôt-Have**. This final category emerged as development progressed and certain features though potentially valuable proved too complex, time-intensive, or peripheral for the scope of a front-end milestone project.

Features marked as **Won‚Äôt-Have** were not removed from consideration altogether, but rather postponed for a future iteration or stretch project once more time and experience could be dedicated to their successful implementation. Below is a summary of the features assigned to this category and the rationale for each decision:

| üü¶ Feature               | Reason for Won‚Äôt-Have Status                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scoreboard**           | Requires data persistence and local storage logic that proved difficult to implement in time. |
| **Save Game**            | Though planned, saving and restoring puzzle state (including grid, timer, clues) required more advanced `JavaScript` than currently manageable. |
| **Print Puzzle Button**  | Would require custom print styling and puzzle state management, which was deprioritized to focus on core interactivity. |
| **Multimedia Instructions** | Recording, editing, and embedding accessible audio/video content exceeded the available development time and required tools outside the project scope. |

These decisions helped ensure that core interactive and accessible features were delivered to a high standard, while leaving the door open for future improvements and enhancements.

### **2.3.2 Site Hierarchy**

Site hierarchy refers to how **Codoku‚Äôs** content, features, and pages are logically organized and accessed by users. It shapes the user‚Äôs journey through the application, affecting clarity, efficiency, and accessibility. For a game-based web app like **Codoku**, hierarchy needed to support both discovery and flow, prioritizing gameplay while offering seamless access to supporting features like instructions and about information.

**Aims of Codoku's Site Structure**

- üè† Make core gameplay immediately accessible with minimal clicks  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Guide users through setup before play (difficulty and timer)  
- ‚ûï Support learning and accessibility with modals and structured layout  

**Codoku** is structured around a single-page core gameplay interface, with supplemental navigation to an About page and modal overlays that support the user without removing them from the experience. Functional elements such as the Setup Modal, Rules Modal, and Completion Feedback act as focused UI components that enhance clarity while keeping the player in flow.

| Page / Modal          | Function                                             | Role in UX Journey           |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Home (Game)**    | Primary interface for Sudoku gameplay                | üéÆ Start, Play, Progress     |
| **Setup Modal**       | Appears before game begins, lets user pick difficulty & timer | ‚öôÔ∏è Customization & Onboarding |
| **Rules Modal**       | On-demand gameplay instructions                      | üßæ Learn & Assist            |
| **About Page**        | Project background and donation information          | üëã Context & Mission         |
| **404 Error Page**    | Redirect users who hit an incorrect route            | ‚ö†Ô∏è Recovery & Redirection    |
| **Completion Modal**  | Feedback, stats, and new game options post-solve     | üèÜ Success & Replay          |

The structure of the Codoku site hierarchy is intentionally designed as a pyramid, placing the most essential user-facing elements at the top and progressively layering supportive or contextual features beneath.

![Codoku Site Hierarchy Pyramid](docs/figures/charts/site-pyramid.webp)  
*A pyramid diagram showing the importance and relationship between the main interface, modals, and support pages in **Codoku**.*

   - Acts as a safeguard across the entire site by redirecting users back to a valid entry point like the Home/Game page.  
   - Enhances accessibility and trust by ensuring all interactions result in a usable path forward.

This structure helps players remain focused on solving puzzles while providing fallback mechanisms and optional exploration without breaking flow or causing confusion.

### **2.3.4 Navigation**

Effective navigation was essential to **Codoku‚Äôs** user experience (UX) design, ensuring users could move confidently between gameplay and supporting content without unnecessary complexity. Because **Codoku** is a game-first web app, navigation needed to feel lightweight, accessible, and non-disruptive, guiding users through core game actions while offering easy access to help, context, and redirection when needed.

**Codoku‚Äôs** navigation follows best practices in clarity, predictability, and responsiveness:

- **Predictability**: Users know where buttons and links will take them.
- **Efficiency**: Core actions like starting a puzzle or checking the rules are one click away.
- **Guidance**: Navigation encourages a clear journey from setup to gameplay and beyond.

The navbar appears persistently across pages and includes quick access to:

üìå **Home**: Puzzle interface and game logic  
üìå **Rules**: Modal with instructions for new users  
üìå **About**: Purpose of the project and donation link  

This ensures users are never far from core functions, while modals and page transitions are used to maintain focus and flow within the single-page app experience.

While gameplay is central, **Codoku** also includes utility pages and overlays:

‚öôÔ∏è **Setup Modal** ‚Äî Opens at launch, allowing users to select difficulty and timer options.  
üßæ **Rules Modal** ‚Äî Available on demand for help.  
üèÜ **Completion Modal** ‚Äî Triggered when the puzzle is solved, showing stats and restart options.  
‚ùå **404 Error Page** ‚Äî Loads when a broken or invalid URL is visited, offering return-to-home navigation.  

These elements are not listed in the main navbar, but play key roles in usability and player flow.

External navigation is minimal, but still present:

üíù **Donation Link** ‚Äì Found in the About page, linking to a trusted cognitive health charity.  
üîó **Social Media Links** ‚Äì Displayed in the site footer for sharing and project visibility (e.g., `GitHub`, LinkedIn).  

These external links open in new tabs to ensure users remain anchored in the **Codoku** experience.

## 2.4.5. Responsiveness

Responsive design is essential to **Codoku‚Äôs** usability and success. As a logic-based puzzle app, **Codoku** prioritizes interaction and accessibility across all devices‚Äîespecially smartphones and tablets, where users often play on the go. A mobile-first approach ensures smooth gameplay, adaptable layouts, and a consistent interface regardless of screen size.

Responsive Design Principles Applied in **Codoku**:
- **Mobile-First Development:** Layouts are designed first for small screens to ensure accessibility on mobile. Touch-friendly interactions are prioritized from the start.
- **Flexible Layouts:** `CSS` Grid and Flexbox allow UI components like the grid, number keys, and buttons to rearrange themselves based on screen size.
- **Media Queries:** Responsive breakpoints allow seamless transitions between mobile, tablet, and desktop views while preserving structure.
- **Optimized Navigation:** A collapsible hamburger menu is used on smaller screens, and fixed nav/footer bars help with orientation.
- **Accessibility:** All buttons are comfortably spaced, font sizes scale with viewport changes, and icons remain easily tappable across devices.

**Codoku** takes advantage of `Bootstrap 5` to manage layout responsiveness. The framework's default breakpoints help scale content across viewports:

| Breakpoint | Label     | Range              | Example Device        |
|------------|-----------|--------------------|------------------------|
| `xs`       | Extra Small | `<576px`          | Small phones           |
| `sm`       | Small      | `‚â•576px`           | Larger phones          |
| `md`       | Medium     | `‚â•768px`           | Tablets                |
| `lg`       | Large      | `‚â•992px`           | Laptops                |
| `xl`       | Extra Large| `‚â•1200px`          | Desktops               |
| `xxl`      | XXL        | `‚â•1400px`          | Large desktops         |

**Codoku‚Äôs** design targets the `sm` breakpoints first, gradually enhancing layout and content presentation for `md`, `lg`, and `xl` screens.

#### **2.4.5.a. Game Page Responsiveness**

## **2.5 Surface**

The **Surface Plane** represents the final layer of **Codoku‚Äôs** UX process‚Äîwhere layout, functionality, and interaction meet a cohesive and refined visual design. While previous stages focused on how the application worked and guided users through content and interactions, the surface focuses on how everything *looks* and *feels*.

For **Codoku**, the surface wasn‚Äôt simply about styling‚Äîit was about creating an accessible, calming, and logic-focused environment that supports player focus and cognitive engagement. Since Sudoku is an activity grounded in mental clarity, **Codoku‚Äôs** interface was designed to be free from distraction while reinforcing thoughtful play.

Rather than adopting complex patterns or overly decorative elements, **Codoku‚Äôs** aesthetic was intentionally minimal, intuitive, and built around:

- Neutral Color Palette  
- Functional Typography  
- Grid-Driven Layout  
- Familiarity & Ergonomics 

Principles That Guided the Surface Design

| Principle            | Application in **Codoku**                                   |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Visual Hierarchy** | Clear typography and spacing prioritize gameplay actions (e.g., New, Check, Clue buttons). |
| **Consistency**      | Repeated layout rules and component styling across modals, buttons, and navigation. |
| **Accessibility**    | High contrast text, large interactive elements, and keyboard/touch compatibility. |
| **Minimal Distraction** | Simple backgrounds and generous white space allow users to focus solely on solving the puzzle. |
| **Subtle Feedback**  | Light hover animations, sound cues, and modals guide without overwhelming. |

**Codoku‚Äôs** surface design complements its purpose: 
- foster logical thinking
- encourage user flow
- create an environment that feels both intelligent and approachable

Every interface decision was filtered through a lens of simplicity and user empathy so that nothing distracts from what really matters... the puzzle.

### **2.5.1 Branding and Aesthetic**

**Codoku‚Äôs** surface design draws inspiration from the clean, logic-focused visuals seen in traditional puzzle spreads‚Äîsuch as those found in newspapers and printed puzzle books.

![Newspaper puzzle spread reference](docs/figures/images/newspaper-puzzle-page.webp)  
*Reference image showing traditional print puzzles like Sudoku, Codeword, and Kakuro.*

Where many puzzle apps adopt vibrant colors and gamified styles, **Codoku** takes a calmer, print-inspired approach. The aim is to provide a focused and thoughtful experience that evokes the feeling of solving puzzles in a newspaper or logic book.

**üîò Minimalism**  
Inspired by black-and-white puzzle spreads, **Codoku** uses a clean layout with minimal distractions to support extended concentration.

**üß© Puzzle-First Layout**  
The Sudoku grid remains the visual and functional centerpiece. Buttons, stats, and UI elements are designed to support‚Äînot compete with‚Äîit.

**üé® Monochrome-Inspired Theme**  
The light and dark modes avoid oversaturation, echoing grayscale design patterns found in print logic puzzles.

**üóûÔ∏è Print-to-Digital Aesthetic**  
**Codoku** brings the tactile familiarity of paper puzzles into the digital age, with responsive layouts and screen-friendly enhancements.

The result is an interface that feels focused, timeless, and cognitively engaging. **Codoku‚Äôs** visual identity is simple yet meaningful‚Äîdesigned for thinkers, logic lovers, and lifelong puzzlers across all devices.

>_Inspired by the pages we‚Äôve been puzzling, poring and pencilling over for decades. **Codoku** puts the print tradition in your pocket._

### **2.5.2 Color Scheme**

Color played a crucial role in **Codoku's** visual identity, enhancing both user experience and accessibility across themes. As a game rooted in logic and feedback, color was used both decoratively and functionally, reinforcing gameplay and user interaction. 

#### **2.5.2.a Dual Theme Design**

**Codoku** uses two themes to support varying lighting conditions and user preference: 

**‚òÄÔ∏è Day Mode**: Light background and dark text for high readability.  
**üåô Night Mode**: Dark background and lighter text to reduce eye strain during extended play or night time use. 

To support both modes, **Codoku's** color system included contrast checked tones for primary, accent and feedback-driven use cases.

#### **2.5.2.b Color Selection Strategy**

The color palette was curated using a combination of WCAG contrast testing and visual harmony tools like Adobe Color. The palette was validated using Contrast Checker and Pilestone‚Äôs Color Vision Simulator to check compatibility for visually impaired users.

![Color Palette](docs/figures/charts/color-chart.webp)  
***Codoku** color swatches for day and night mode.*

Background  
> #F8F9FA (Off-white) ‚ö™   
> #212529 (Off-black) ‚ö´  

These tones mirror the visual softness of black-and-white newspaper prints, evoking a sense of logic, calm, and familiarity.

Key Accents
> #E0B336 (Yellow) üü°  
> #403A6B (Purple) üü£ 

These complementary colors were selected for their strong contrast and symbolic representation of day vs. night.

Feedback Colors
> #285228 or #A5F3A5(Green) üü¢  
> #7D2525 or #F69696 (Red) üî¥ 

Green will signpost numbers revealed by the Clue button, reinforcing positive feedback. Red will highlight incorrect numbers when the Check function is used. These will aid users through intuitive color cues, globally understood as correct and incorrect respectively.

**Color Accessibility**

To ensure **Codoku‚Äôs** color combinations met accessibility standards, the WCAG 2.1 guidelines were followed using a contrast checker tool. Each pair was tested to verify readability and UI clarity, especially across different lighting conditions and vision types.

![Color Contrast Chart](docs/figures/charts/contrast-chart.webp)  
*Contrast matrix showing WCAG-compliant pairings used in **Codoku's** UI design.*

The image above displays a contrast ratio matrix, where the circled values indicate the approved combinations used throughout **Codoku‚Äôs** interface. These selections exceed 7:1 for enhanced clarity.

To ensure **Codoku's** interface remained inclusive, color accessibility was tested using a color blindness simulator by Pilestone. This visual tool helped preview how the chosen palette would appear to users with different types of color vision deficiency, including:
- Deutan (green-weak)
- Protan (red-weak)
- Tritan (blue-yellow deficiency)

![Color Vision Simulator](docs/figures/charts/color-vision-simulator.webp)  
*Simulated color palette display across various forms of color blindness.*

This process reinforced WCAG compliance and ensured **Codoku** remained readable and engaging for a wide spectrum of users.

### **2.5.3. Typography**

Typography played a critical role in **Codoku‚Äôs** design, shaping both visual personality and readability. The typefaces were selected to reflect the project‚Äôs brand aesthetic, emphasizing clarity, a retro-futuristic style, and an inviting tone for users across devices.

#### **2.5.3.a Primary Typeface: Space Mono**
Space Mono was selected as **Codoku‚Äôs** primary typeface for headings, navigation, and puzzle-related labels. Its monospaced design and geometric structure align with the game‚Äôs logical nature and retro-code aesthetic.

*Screenshots of font previews on Google Fonts. From top to bottom: Space Mono, Quicksand.*

Font delivery was handled via Google Fonts, ensuring fast loading and cross-platform rendering. The font sizes were responsive and set using rem units to adapt across screen sizes. `Bootstrap`‚Äôs base typography classes (e.g., .display-6, .lead, .fw-bold) were layered on top of these fonts for scalable responsiveness and accessibility compliance.

### **2.5.4 Backgrounds**

In **Codoku**, background design plays a vital role in enhancing both aesthetic appeal and usability across themes. Two primary background textures are used. One for Day Mode and one for Night Mode, ensuring each theme provides visual consistency and immersive contrast.

![Day mode background](assets/backgrounds/light-background.webp)
*Subtle, tactile paper texture reinforces clarity and approachability.*

![Night mode background](assets/backgrounds/dark-background.webp)
*Soft charcoal texture simulates print paper for a soothing dark theme.*

These backgrounds were sourced from the Unsplash Creative Photo Community and chosen for their subtle, paper-like textures. They evoke the familiar feel of traditional printed puzzles, aligning with **Codoku's** branding as a calming, cognitively engaging digital experience.

Both backgrounds are static (non-scrolling) to minimize motion distractions and preserve a sense of stability throughout gameplay. This static design choice reflects the calming, analog qualities of a physical Sudoku grid‚Äîgrounding users in the puzzle-solving experience.

#### **2.5.4.a Design Application**
**Body**: Acts as the foundation of the user interface, providing consistent tactile background context.

**Navbar & Footer**: These structural elements inherit the background texture to reinforce thematic coherence.

**Modals**: Setup, Rules, and Completion modals blend with the background while remaining clearly defined using inner container styling.

The visual contrast between the soft off-white paper texture and the charcoal fiber pattern ensures each mode feels distinct but consistent in tone, emphasizing calmness, focus, and logic-driven thinking.

By using grounded textures over flat colors, **Codoku's** interface subtly reinforces the tactile satisfaction of pen-and-paper puzzle-solving‚Äîbridging the nostalgia of analog games with the accessibility of digital design.

#### **2.5.4.b Fallback Color Support**  
To support environments where background images may not load or where high-contrast settings are enabled, fallback colors were defined in the `CSS` using values from **Codoku‚Äôs** palette:

> #F8F9FA (Off-white) ‚ö™ for Day Mode  
> #212529 (Off-black) ‚ö´ for Night Mode

These shades were chosen not only to preserve contrast and readability in the absence of textures, but also to mimic the soft greyscale tones of printed newspaper pages.

This approach ensures WCAG-compliant contrast across modes while staying true to the project's visual identity. Even in simplified rendering environments, the fallback maintains **Codoku‚Äôs** minimalist, calming feel, supporting a broad range of accessibility needs and device capabilities.

### **2.5.5 Imagery**

Visual storytelling played a subtle but important role in shaping **Codoku‚Äôs** surface layer. A small collection of hand-picked images and a bespoke illustration were used across the site to support branding and reinforce user engagement through tone, familiarity, and theme.

#### **2.5.5.a About Page Imagery** 
The first three images were selected or created specifically for the About page, where they helped communicate **Codoku‚Äôs** purpose and tone of voice. These image blocks were inserted between paragraphs to offer breathing space, aesthetic variety, and subtle visual storytelling.

üì∞ **Newspaper Sudoku Puzzle** photograph (sourced from the Unsplash) evokes the tactile, analog origins of logic games, grounding **Codoku** in a familiar and nostalgic context.

*Photograph of a child and older adult working together to solve a **Codoku** puzzle on tablet.*

Together, these visuals help convey that **Codoku** is more than just a game‚Äîit‚Äôs a cognitive, accessible, and multi-generational tool for mindful play.

#### **2.5.5.b 404 Page Illustration**
To maintain brand consistency and a sense of humor, a custom hand-drawn illustration was created for the 404 Error page. Styled like a vintage newspaper comic strip with a headline proclaiming a '404 Alert' the image places a missing puzzle grid front and center. The image was then edited in Sketchbook to refine and digitize. This approach:

![Person reading newspaper with front page message describing 404 alert](assets/images/breaking-news.webp)
*Illustration of a person in business attire reading the news paper with 404 message alert on front page.*

- Reinforces the printed-paper puzzle theme used across the site
- Keeps the user experience light and on-brand even during navigation errors
- Adds personality while subtly guiding users back to the main game

This design was deliberately playful, matching the tone of **Codoku** without compromising usability or clarity.

All imagery, both photographic and illustrated, was intentionally presented in black and white. This stylistic decision was made to maintain visual cohesion across both day and night themes, reinforce the print-inspired aesthetic, and reduce visual noise to keep focus on the puzzle interface itself. 

### **2.5.6 Buttons**

The buttons and number keys on **Codoku** were designed to enhance clarity, accessibility, and tactile feedback across both themes. Inspired by physical interactions, their visual style was developed to feel familiar, playful, and functional.

All **core interactive buttons** (New, Check, Clue, etc.) share a consistent layout and structure, but invert color schemes between Day and Night Mode:

![Wireframe GIF showing button styling](docs/figures/gifs/buttons.gif)
*GIF to illustrate the hover affects and styling for the buttons. Left to Right: Day Mode, Night Mode.*

The goal was to offer high contrast and accessibility in both visual environments, while also providing a satisfying user experience through visual feedback. Button text uses Space Mono for its clean, bold styling and coding-inspired tone.

The **number keys** (1‚Äì9 and ‚®â for erase) are exclusive to the Game page. These were styled to resemble raised keyboard keys with:

![Wireframe GIF showing number keys styling](docs/figures/gifs/number-keys.gif)
*GIF to illustrate the hover affects and styling for the Number keys.*

- A monochrome color palette remains consistent for both themes
- Bold outlines to reinforce the tactile quality
- Hover effects that lighten or darken depending on the mode
- Click feedback using subtle animations and shadows

These keys provide an alternative to typing, making **Codoku** accessible for touch users and enhancing the physicality of the digital experience.

### **2.5.7 Iconography**
Icons played a subtle but important role, serving as recognizable micro-interactions for navigation, feedback, and brand presence. Their inclusion helped create an intuitive UI by reducing the cognitive load needed to interpret functional elements.

#### **2.5.7.a Favicon**
A custom site favicon was created using Canva and exported as an .ico file using an online favicon generator. This was added to the site‚Äôs <head> element, allowing **Codoku** to have a recognizable tab icon and establishing a subtle brand identity in browser environments.

![Codoku Favicon](assets/favicons/android-chrome-192x192.png)   
***Codoku** Favicon Preview*

#### **2.5.7.b Font Awesome Integration**
All functional icons in **Codoku** were provided by Font Awesome to ensure clarity and visual consistency. These included:
- Theme toggle icon (sun/moon)
- Back and Enter arrows on modal and alert buttons
- Social media logos in the footer (Facebook, Instagram, X/Twitter)

These vector icons are scalable and accessible, improving responsiveness and load times while supporting screen reader compatibility.

#### **2.5.7.c Hover Effects & Feedback**
To enhance interactivity, hover styles were applied to all clickable icons, especially the social media links in the footer. On hover, each icon:
- Enlarges slightly with a soft transform scale
- Gains a subtle drop shadow or brightness change
- Uses a cursor pointer to reinforce clickability

![Wireframe GIF to show navbar hover effects for icons](docs/figures/gifs/socials.gif)   
*GIF to illustrate the hover affects and styling for the social media icons in the site footer.*

These animations provide intuitive feedback, inviting users to engage with external content without the need for additional explanatory text.

Icons were styled using either the light (#F8F9FA) or dark (#212529) theme colors, depending on the mode selected. They dynamically inverted based on the theme toggle to maintain contrast and legibility.

# 4. **Process and Methodology**
The development of **Codoku** followed a structured, iterative methodology rooted in best practices for front-end application design. Unlike content-driven websites, **Codoku‚Äôs** success depended on thoughtful logic flow, modular scripting, and reactive feedback systems. This section outlines the processes and architectural strategies used from scoped feature planning and code mapping to milestone-based development tracked through `Git` commits.

## **4.1 Approach**
This section outlines the key development principles applied, each of which helped ensure accessibility, maintainability, and user-centered design. Additionally, it highlights how I mapped my `JavaScript` logic ahead of time to define reusable functions and avoid duplication before building the final game logic.

###  **4.1.1 Mobile-First Development** üì±
**Codoku** was designed first and foremost for mobile interaction, following a mobile-first development strategy rooted in accessibility and real-device testing.

All core components including the Sudoku grid, number buttons, modals, and feedback controls ‚Äî were initially developed using a `max-width: 100%` and `flex-column` layout to suit small screens. Button sizing and spacing were optimized for touch interaction, with minimal reliance on hover states (which are not accessible on mobile). Early styling choices prioritized clarity, spacing, and responsiveness to short viewports and portrait orientation.

Accessibility on mobile was a key priority from the start. I followed WCAG 2.1 mobile compliance guidelines by:
- Ensuring sufficient contrast between foreground and background (especially in dark mode),
- Keeping interactive touch targets at least 48x48 pixels where possible although challenging for the grid cells
- Avoiding absolute positioning of buttons that could become unreachable in smaller viewports,
- Adding focus states and semantic ARIA labels for users relying on screen readers or tab navigation on mobile assistive devices.

To ensure the UI worked in real-world scenarios, I tested the early game build using Chrome DevTools‚Äô device emulation and on multiple real mobile devices, including phones loaned by family and friends. This helped uncover layout quirks that wouldn‚Äôt have appeared in simulated testing environments, such as spacing bugs or clipped elements in landscape mode.

Once the mobile version was fully functional and accessible, I scaled the design upward using custom media queries and `Bootstrap` breakpoints. These breakpoints progressively adjusted:
- Grid size and padding
- Number key spacing
- Font sizes and modal widths
- Button layout

This approach allowed **Codoku** to adapt fluidly to tablets, laptops, and desktop environments without compromising the core mobile experience. The result is a site that feels native on phones but scales gracefully to larger screens, maintaining accessibility and ease of use across all devices.

### **4.1.2 Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Model** üéØ
To ensure focus and structure throughout development, I followed the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) model ‚Äî delivering core features first before progressing to enhancements. This strategy helped avoid feature creep and ensured that the game would remain usable, responsive, and testable at every stage of development.

To facilitate this, I used a [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/TeseoLou/projects/4/views/1) to: 

- Map the full scope of the project at the beginning, breaking it down into manageable tasks like 'Grid Generation', 'Check' Button, and 'Difficulty Selector'.
- Use the Must-Have label to mark core features that the game couldn‚Äôt function without (e.g., interactive grid, puzzle generation, input validation).
- Use Should-Have and Could-Have labels for enhancements that could be deferred until after the core logic was complete (e.g., sound effects, social links, animations).
- Help define chronological order: For example, the game couldn‚Äôt be validated until the puzzle grid was generated, so 'Grid Generation' was placed before 'Check' Button or 'Clue' Button.
- Ensure I was never overwhelmed: each ‚ÄúDone‚Äù task gave me visible progress, and I could easily reprioritize if something proved more complex than expected.

### **4.1.3 Semantic HTML** üåê
**Codoku** was built using semantic `HTML` to ensure the structure of the application was both meaningful and accessible. Structural elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and `<button>` were consistently used to define the layout and purpose of each section. 

Semantic accuracy was especially critical for a game interface like **Codoku**, where dynamic interaction is constant. ARIA attributes such as `aria-labelledby`, `aria-modal`, and `role="dialog"` were used to improve modal accessibility, ensuring that screen readers could announce modal headings and lock focus appropriately when active. Elements like game controls and toggle switches were built using `<input type="checkbox">` and `<button>` instead of `<div>` or `<span>` to retain their native keyboard and accessibility behavior.

| Tool                          | Purpose                                     | How It Helped                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **WAVE**                      | Tested HTML semantics, ARIA usage, contrast | Identified missing labels, improper heading nesting, ARIA misuse, and contrast warnings during development.        |
| **axe DevTools**              | Automated accessibility testing extension   | Performed audits with actionable feedback, including structure, contrast, and semantic hierarchy checks.  |
| **W3Schools + MDN Web Docs**  | Semantic element reference                  | Helped validate correct use of elements (e.g., `fieldset` + `legend`, `button`), improving form semantics.        |
| **Lighthouse**               | Accessibility and performance auditing   | Verified semantic layout, heading order, and ARIA use. Contributed to Codoku‚Äôs accessibility score.               |
| **NVDA**                      | Screen reader testing                       | Used to test navigation and modal behavior from a non-visual perspective, ensuring ARIA and heading structures worked as expected. |

These helped enforce best practices throughout the project lifecycle. Every key element was evaluated to ensure it conveyed meaning not only visually, but programmatically ‚Äî a core principle of accessible web design.

### **4.1.4 CSS Styling & Methodology** üé®  
**Codoku‚Äôs** visual design was constructed using a modular, layered `CSS` approach ‚Äî combining a custom `style.css` file with the `Bootstrap 5`.3 framework. Styling prioritized mobile-first responsiveness, dark/light theming, accessibility, and clean layout management across game views and modal components.

The `style.css` file was clearly organized using section headers and comment blocks to guide readability and maintainability. Notable sections included:
- Grid and board styling (`#grid`, `.number`, `.bottom-border`, `.right-border`)
- Modal styling (`.modal-content`, `.modal-border`, custom `#setup-modal`, `#rules-modal`)
- Theme-aware components using `.dark` modifiers
- Toggle switch customization (`#theme-switch`, `#sound-switch`)
- Responsive layout tuning for header, footer, and game containers

`Bootstrap` was used primarily to:
- Create a responsive grid system
- Style forms, buttons, modals, and navbars
- Add consistent spacing, typography, and button states
- Provide ARIA-compatible components out of the box

**Codoku** supports **light and dark themes**, toggled via a switch stored in `localStorage`. The `applyTheme()` function in `theme.js` applied `CSS` class `.dark` to `<body>` when appropriate, and the stylesheet handled visual differences using the `body.dark` selector prefix.

| Tool / Resource              | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bootstrap 5.3**           | Core responsive layout, modals, buttons, spacing, grid helpers          |
| **W3Schools + MDN**         | Confirming correct `CSS` syntax, selectors, and specificity management     |
| **Can I use**               | Verified browser compatibility for newer `CSS` properties (e.g., `gap`)   |
| **Chrome DevTools**         | Live-editing `CSS` during development to test responsiveness              |
| **Specificity Calculator**  | Helped analyze and balance selector weight to avoid using `!important` where possible  |

These helped ensure responsive design principles were applied correctly, selectors remained efficient and conflict-free, and the styling remained compatible across modern browsers.

### **4.1.5 JavaScript Architecture & Development** üìù
**Codoku‚Äôs** interactivity is powered by a modular, planned `JavaScript` architecture spread across clearly scoped files. These scripts drive puzzle logic, input handling, interface feedback, modals, and user settings such as theme and sound.

Before coding, I mapped out the core logic required to power the game, breaking down each feature into core and helper functions. This pre-planning ensured every piece of logic had a clear role and avoided repetition.

#### **4.1.5.a Puzzle Flow**
`fetchSudokuBoard()`  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `renderEmptyGrid()`   
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ `populateGrid()`  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ `enableCellSelection()`  

`triggerAutoWinCheck()`  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `isBoardCompleteAndCorrect()`  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `isBoardFilled()`  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `formatElapsedTime()`  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `popConfetti()`  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ `showAlertModal()`  

This section is the backbone of the game logic. It handles fetching puzzles from the API, rendering them on the board, and checking for win conditions. It ensures a start-to-end experience as users solve the Sudoku grid.

#### **4.1.5.b User Interaction & Input**
`enableCellSelection()`  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `handleClick()`  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `handleKeyboardInput()`   
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ `handleNumberKeyClick()`   
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ `triggerAutoWinCheck()`   

`checkUserInput()`   
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ `updateHintsDisplay()`   

`revealHint()`  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `updateHintsDisplay()`  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ `triggerAutoWinCheck()` 

This group of functions manage how users interact with the board, selecting cells, entering numbers, and getting clues or feedback. Real-time checking helps maintain engagement, while the modular hinting system supports player learning without spoiling the challenge.

#### **4.1.5.c Setup & Game State**
`startNewGame()`  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `fetchSudokuBoard()`  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `startTimer()`  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `updateDifficultyDisplay()`  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `updateHintsDisplay()`  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reset `hasCelebrated` flag

`startTimer()`  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ `updateTimerDisplay()`

`setupThemeSwitch()`  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ `applyTheme()`

`applyTheme(isLightMode)`  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Save to `localStorage`

`setupSoundToggle()`  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ `applySoundSetting()`

`applySoundSetting()`  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Update UI icons and switch state

`setupStartButton()`  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ `startNewGame()`

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Show `Bootstrap` modal

`initPage() ` 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `setupOutsideNavbarCollapse()`  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `setupThemeSwitch()`  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `setupStartButton()`  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ `setupSoundToggle()`  

This group manages the game‚Äôs structure and settings. It controls how the game is initialized, how timers run, and how theme and sound preferences persist between sessions. All logic here ensures continuity and accessibility without requiring user repetition or manual resets.

The following tools and references were used to streamline `JavaScript` writing, debugging, and testing throughout the development process. These supported everything from logic planning and DOM interaction to code quality checks and browser-side inspection.

| Tool/Resource          | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **jQuery**                 | Simplified DOM manipulation, AJAX requests, and event handling          |
| **Bootstrap (JS)**         | Provided modal, collapse, and accessibility-friendly component behavior |
| **API Ninjas**             | Delivered Sudoku puzzles and solutions via `fetchSudokuBoard()`         |
| **DevTools Console**       | Used for inspecting object structures, errors, and live debugging       |
| **W3Schools & MDN**        | Referenced regularly for syntax, best practices, and event flow patterns|
| **Stack Overflow**         | Troubleshooting edge cases and searching community-tested patterns      |
| **JS Hint**                | Provided static code analysis to flag potential issues                  |
| **Static App JS Formatter**| Used to clean up and consistently format `JavaScript` code                |
| **Diff Checker**           | Helped compare and revert to previous working versions of `JavaScript`    |

These tools were instrumental in maintaining high code quality, preventing bugs, and speeding up the process of writing interactive features. Real-time testing using DevTools and `jQuery` also helped ensure consistent behavior across different browsers and devices.

### **4.1.6 Code Documentation & Commenting** üí¨

**Codoku's** `JavaScript` files in particular were structured with consistent documentation, especially at the function level. Each significant function includes a **multi-line docstring** that outlines:

- The purpose of the function
- Return values or expected outcome
- Related or dependent function calls

This style supported maintainability, quick debugging, and clarity when retracing logic across files.

As someone who is neurodivergent, writing code in small, clearly defined steps was key to staying focused and reducing cognitive load. During early development, I commented nearly every line of code to help structure my thought process. This became a form of pseudocode planning, which allowed me to:

- Map logic before implementing functionality
- Visually track how variables and flows connected
- Reframe the code in plain language to reinforce understanding
- Easily return to code after taking breaks

Once features were stable and tested, I returned to each file to remove redundant comments, leaving behind only meaningful, non-obvious explanations. This kept the final version clean but still richly documented.

| Tool / Extension             | Purpose & Role in Development |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **VS Code Comment Shortcuts** | Referenced the [VSCode Comment Guide](https://vscode.one/comment-vscode/) for best practices. |
| **Auto Comment Extension**   | Aided in rewording overly descriptive comment lines using AI for selected `JavaScript` snippets. | 
| **Code Spell Checker**       | Prevented typos in explanatory comments and headers. Useful for maintaining professionalism. |

Using tools like Auto Comment was particularly helpful when I needed to describe logic I had already written but found hard to summarize later. It provided concise, relevant suggestions that I could either keep as-is or adapt.

The combination of structured documentation, pseudocode-style commenting, and AI-powered support tools helped transform my workflow. Commenting wasn‚Äôt just for others‚Äîit became an essential bridge between logic and language for myself throughout development.

### **4.1.7 SMART Objectives** üìå 
To manage **Codoku's** feature development effectively, I used the SMART framework ensuring that every development task was:

- **S**pecific: Clearly defined with a known purpose  
- **M**easurable: Could be tested or verified  
- **A**chievable: Realistic within my current skill level  
- **R**ealistic: Appropriate in scope and timing  
- **T**ime-bound: Could be scoped within a focused session or day

This structure helped me work efficiently through the most critical tasks first, using my `GitHub` Project Board to track each milestone. Below is a breakdown of SMART objectives, ordered by priority and development sequence, beginning with layout and structure, then followed by interactivity and enhancement.

| Objective                                            | Specific                                              | Measurable                                        | Achievable                                                                     | Realistic                                                                     | Time-Bound                                                 |

### **4.1.8 Git Version Control with Purposeful Commits** üíæ
Throughout **Codoku‚Äôs** development, `Git` and `GitHub` were used as the backbone of version control. Commit messages were written intentionally and descriptively, forming a timeline of the project‚Äôs evolution.

This structure supported:
- **Traceability** ‚Äì With an aim to ensure every feature or fix was committed individually 
- **Problem Solving** ‚Äì I was able to compare earlier versions of files when debugging logic, checking modal behavior, or reverting styling.
- **Safe Experimentation** ‚Äì With frequent commits, rollbacks were quick, letting me test sound, timer, and theme interactions without risk.

To complement `GitHub`'s interface and VS Code‚Äôs built-in `Git` tools, I used the `Git` History to gain deeper visibility into my project‚Äôs evolution:

| Tool / Platform             | Purpose |
|----------------------------|---------|
| **Diff Checker**       | Helped with comparing long `JavaScript`/`CSS` files before and after refactors. |
| **Git History (VS Code Extension)** | Viewed line-by-line changes, commit trees, file histories, and comparisons directly in `VS Code`. |
| **Conventional Commit Structure** | Messages attempted to followed a ‚Äúwhat, where, why‚Äù pattern for clarity and traceability. |

Using these tools helped ensure every change was documented and intentional. This approach hoped to not only improve my personal development discipline, but also create a clean, professional commit history useful for tutors and my future self.

## **4.2 Initial Setup**

The early stages of **Codoku's** development focused on laying a solid foundation for a responsive, accessible, and interactive single-page web application. This involved establishing essential `HTML` structure, linking key stylesheets and scripts, and preparing the project for scalable logic integration.

### **4.2.1 HTML Scaffold & Metadata**

The first few commits established the semantic base of the website:
- üèóÔ∏è Added basic `HTML` pages (`index.html`, `about.html`, and `404.html`)
- üì¶ Included meta tags for:
  - Character encoding
  - Viewport settings for responsive scaling
  - Author info
  - SEO and social sharing compatibility
- üîó Connected external resources:
  - `Bootstrap` (via CDN)
  - Google Fonts
  - Font Awesome
  - Favicon

### **4.2.2 Responsive Navigation & Structure**

Once base pages were in place, I moved to layout and navigation:
- üîÅ Implemented a responsive `Bootstrap` **navbar** with:
  - Rules modal trigger
  - Collapsible hamburger menu
- ‚öôÔ∏è Created placeholder sections for:
  - Game grid
  - Number input keys
  - Game stats
  - Footer content with social links

![Early HTML output without styling](docs/figures/screenshots/basic-html-structure.webp)  
*Basic HTML layout rendered in browser before any CSS styling was applied.*

### **4.2.3 Base CSS and Dark Mode Architecture**

The stylesheet was scaffolded to reflect consistent visual identity and support theme switching:
- üé® Declared `CSS` custom properties for:
  - Font family (`Space Mono`)
  - Backgrounds and foregrounds
  - Accent colors for light/dark modes
- üß© Structured style sections by:
  - Layout containers
  - Typography
  - Custom components (modals, grid, buttons)
- üåí `body.dark` class styling to prepare for dark mode theming across all major elements.

### **4.2.4 JavaScript File Architecture & Linking**

To keep logic modular, I created the following JS files early:
> `game.js` ‚Äì Core gameplay and board logic  
> `theme.js` ‚Äì Dark/light mode and localStorage persistence  
> `setup-modal.js` ‚Äì Start game logic and modal behavior  
> `navbar.js` ‚Äì Navbar behavior and navigation safeguards  
> `init.js` ‚Äì Page lifecycle and modal boot logic 

These were linked at the bottom of `index.html` to avoid DOM timing issues.

![Codoku Repository Structure ‚Äì Expanded](docs/figures/screenshots/repository-setup.webp)  
*Expanded repository view showing modular JavaScript files, HTML pages, and the core stylesheet for **Codoku**.*

## **4.3 Page Template**
Once the initial project folder and file structure was in place, the next step was to establish a universal page template that could be reused across all `HTML` pages. This involved building out shared structural components and styling elements that define **Codoku‚Äôs** visual identity and layout consistency.

The goal was to create a flexible yet robust `HTML` + `CSS` foundation that could be duplicated into every page and would only require page-specific content edits going forward.

**Key Components of the Universal Template:**  

Metadata and Dependencies
  - Meta tags for viewport, character encoding, and accessibility  
  - Google Fonts for typography  
  - `Bootstrap 5.3` CDN for layout and component responsiveness  
  - FontAwesome for icons  
  - Favicon links  
  - `style.css` for custom styling  

Semantic Layout Structure   
- Structural landmarks shared by all pages:
  - Responsive `Bootstrap` navbar with theme and sound toggles  
  - The central content area, customized per page  
  - Footer with copyright and social  

Thematic Styling Foundations
- The global `CSS` file handled:
  - Typography hierarchy 
  - Color variables for light/dark modes and accessibility contrast  
  - Background textures for day and night themes  
  - Base styling for navigation, modals, grid containers, and responsive layout  

Once complete, this template structure was cloned into each page and slightly modified based on purpose.

![Codoku Page Template Preview](docs/figures/screenshots/template-preview.webp)  
*Example of the universal page template featuring toggles, navbar, and footer with background texture styling.*

From this point on, any correction, accessibility fix, or layout tweak made to the shared features (navbar, footer, modals, toggles, etc.) had to be applied across every `HTML` page to maintain consistency.

This modular and scalable structure ensured:
- Fewer bugs during UI changes  
- Easier integration of JS logic across pages  
- Faster adaptation of updates (like styling refinements or theme adjustments)

## **4.4 Workflow**
After establishing the reusable page template (with shared `HTML` layout, background styling, navbar, footer, and toggle elements), development progressed through a deliberate, layered sequence, gradually building structure, style, interactivity and logic while ensuring each feature worked independently before being integrated.

### **4.4.1. Refining Structural HTML Elements**
Page titles, headers, button containers, and stat panels were added to define clear visual anchors for gameplay. Additional semantic containers and ARIA landmarks were incorporated.

Boilerplate copies of this layout were added to `about.html` and `404.html`, ensuring consistency across all pages.

![Screenshot of early HTML layout with some styling components.](docs/figures/screenshots/headings.webp)  
*Early HTML scaffold showing the **Codoku** title, action buttons, and placeholder sections.*

### **4.4.2. Laying Out Core Visual Components**
The Sudoku grid container and number input area were blocked out. The 'Game Stats' section was also scaffolded beneath the header.

![HTML structure for Codoku‚Äôs number input controls with semantic tags and Bootstrap classes](docs/figures/screenshots/game-section-html-structure.webp)  
*HTML scaffold for the Sudoku board and number keys, using semantic elements.*

### **4.4.3 Creating the Rules and Setup Modals**
I laid the groundwork for **Codoku‚Äôs** two primary modals: the Rules Modal and the Setup Modal.

![Bootstrap modal shells created for Setup and Rules](docs/figures/screenshots/basic-modal-structure.webp)  
*Initial modal markup for the Setup and Rules components before styling or logic was applied.*

### **4.4.4 Adding Theme and Sound**
I integrated the interface toggle for Theme (light/dark mode) and added sounds to be utilized in user feedback logic. This was the first time user preferences were stored persistently, marking a shift toward a more state-aware application. 

![Theme and Sound Toggles in Light and Dark Mode with Audio File Directory](docs/figures/screenshots/theme-toggle-and-sound.webp)  
*Theme and sound toggles shown in both dark and light modes (left), alongside the full list of mp3 sound files used in the **Codoku** project (right).*

### **4.4.5 Rendering the Sudoku Grid**
The logic for rendering an empty sudoku grid was created to build a 9√ó9 structure with data attributes for row/col tracking and styling.

![Initial empty Sudoku grid rendered via JavaScript](docs/figures/screenshots/empty-grid.webp)  
*The rendered empty Sudoku board.*

### **4.4.6 Puzzle Generation & Population**
The game connected to an online puzzle generator, API Ninjas, to load Sudoku boards. Fixed numbers were filled in automatically, while the rest were styled to show they could be edited by the player.
![Generated Sudoku grid from API Ninjas](docs/figures/screenshots/generated-grid.webp)  
*An example of a dynamically generated Sudoku puzzle retrieved from the API and rendered on the board.*

### **4.4.7 Enabling User Input**
The board was made interactive so players could click cells, type numbers, and use on-screen buttons. Extra features were added to highlight mistakes and give hints when needed.
![Interactive cell selection and entry on Sudoku grid](docs/figures/gifs/user-input.gif)  
*A screen recording showing user input interaction ‚Äî selecting a cell and entering numbers either via keyboard or on-screen buttons.*


### **4.4.8 Game State Management**
The main game logic was set up to load a new puzzle, start the timer, and track things like hints and difficulty. The interface updated live as the game progressed to keep the player informed.
![Game stats panel which updates with countdown and on check and clue reveal button interaction](docs/figures/screenshots/game-stat-panel.webp)  
*The game stats panel tracks the selected difficulty, elapsed time, and number of hints used in real-time.*

### **4.4.9 Visual Feedback & Win Conditions**
A system was added to check if the puzzle was complete, show a win or error message, and play matching sound effects. Confetti was added for wins, and modals were styled to match the theme and outcome.

![Game Completion Celebration](docs/figures/gifs/game-win.gif)  
*A successful puzzle completion triggers the celebration modal and visual feedback, including confetti and game stats.*

### **4.4.10 Adding Navigation Safeguards**
Navigation was improved to alert users before leaving an active game and to automatically close the menu on mobile after clicks for a smoother experience.

![Navigation Safeguard Modal](docs/figures/gifs/navigation-safeguard.gif)    
*A safeguard modal prevents accidental navigation away from the game mid-session, reinforcing user flow and focus.*

### **4.4.11 Creating the About Page**
The About page was designed as a static section to explain **Codoku‚Äôs** concept and goals. Shared layout elements like the header, footer, theme toggle, and navbar were reused for consistency. 

![About Page Preview](docs/figures/gifs/about-page.gif)  
*The completed About page, featuring clear typography, thematic styling, and accessible layout.*

### **4.4.12 Implementing the 404 Error Page**
A custom 404 page was added to improve the user experience when a non-existent route is accessed. It reused the existing styling framework and followed semantic structure and accessibility best practices. 

![404 Page Animation](docs/figures/gifs/404-page.gif)   
*Preview of **Codoku‚Äôs** custom 404 page, styled with themed typography and a hand-drawn comic-style illustration.*

### **4.4.13 Responsive Implementations with Testing**
Text, grid sizing, and spacing were adjusted to stay consistent on all screen sizes, using DevTools and real devices for live responsiveness testing.

![Codoku Responsiveness Demonstration](docs/figures/gifs/responsiveness.gif)  
*Responsive design adapting fluidly to tablet, desktop, and mobile viewports.*

## **4.5 Feedback and Refinement**
Following a detailed mid-project review, a number of constructive suggestions were offered that significantly helped fine-tune the **Codoku** experience. 

### **4.5.1 Interface & Usability Enhancements**
Mentor feedback highlighted the need for more polished and modern interaction elements. The most impactful updates were as follows:

#### **4.5.1.a New Game Modal on Page Load**
During feedback review, it was highlighted that new users landing on the game page were left without clear guidance on how to begin playing. This initial confusion stemmed from the lack of a structured introduction or setup flow.

To address this:
- A New Game Setup Modal was introduced to automatically appear on page load.
- It prompts users to choose difficulty and timer settings before accessing the puzzle.
- The Cancel button was removed to prevent players from accidentally closing the modal without making a selection.
- The modal was configured to disable dismissal via clicking outside or pressing Esc, using `Bootstrap`‚Äôs backdrop and keyboard options.

![Initial Setup Modal](docs/figures/screenshots/start-up-modal.webp)  
*The modal guides users through difficulty and timer selection upon first visiting the site, improving orientation and reducing confusion.*

This change significantly improved onboarding clarity by ensuring players are properly introduced to the game mechanics every time they load the page.

#### **4.5.1.b Improved Modals for Feedback**
Initial user feedback and accessibility best practices highlighted that native alert boxes, while functional, pose several usability and design limitations, particularly in modern web applications.

To address this:
- All alerts were replaced with `Bootstrap` modals.
- Used for timeout warnings, invalid input, and hint-based wins.
- The modals respect dark/light themes and support keyboard navigation.

![Puzzle Feedback Modals](docs/figures/screenshots/new-modals.webp)  
*Custom Bootstrap modals provide consistent styling and clearer user feedback for puzzle outcomes, invalid actions, and timeouts.*

This overhaul brought consistency and visual cohesion to how feedback is presented, ensuring that players remain immersed in the game environment while still receiving clear, accessible notifications.

#### **4.5.1.c ‚å´ 'Clear' Button Enhancement**
The original 'X' icon used for clearing a selected Sudoku cell was ambiguous. Users, especially those less familiar with interface conventions, might confuse it with a close or cancel action. This ambiguity posed a usability and accessibility challenge, particularly for users relying on screen readers or cognitive clarity.

To improve clarity and inclusivity, the following changes were made:
- Replaced the icon with a different button reading ‚Äú‚å´‚Äù.
- Styled the button to visually resemble a physical delete key (like Shift/Delete on a keyboard).

![Clear Button Redesign](docs/figures/screenshots/new-clear-button.webp)  
*A styled ‚ÄúClear‚Äù button that resembles a physical delete key improves clarity and accessibility, replacing the ambiguous ‚ÄúX‚Äù icon.*

This adjustment improved user understanding, reduced interaction errors, and enhanced overall accessibility.

### **4.5.2 Accessibility Considerations**
To enhance inclusivity and align with accessibility standards, several thoughtful changes were implemented:

#### **4.5.2.a Sound Toggle for Sensory Consideration**
Originally, the game featured sounds for feedback (e.g., errors, confirmations) that played automatically. The lack of user control over audio also conflicted with WCAG accessibility guidelines.

To ensure a more inclusive and respectful experience, a dedicated Sound Toggle was implemented:
- Defaults to "off" on first page load to avoid unexpected sound.
- Stores the user‚Äôs choice using localStorage, preserving their preference across sessions.
- Visual indicators show the current state:
  - Red for muted üî¥ 
  - Green for sound on üü¢
  
![Sound Toggle](docs/figures/screenshots/new-sound-toggle.webp)  
*The sound toggle defaults to muted on page load‚Äîsupporting sensory-friendly design.*

This improvement gave users full control over audio feedback, aligning with sensory-friendly design standards.

### **4.5.3 Functional Refinements**
Feedback also highlighted subtle functional issues that were quickly addressed to improve overall gameplay flow:

#### **4.5.3.a Timer Reset Fix**
During feedback, it was discovered that when starting a new game with ‚ÄúNo Timer‚Äù selected, the countdown from a previous timed game would sometimes continue running. This caused confusion and led to inconsistent gameplay experiences.

To fix this I: 
- Cleared any existing countdown intervals before starting a new game.
- Verified that selecting ‚ÄúNo Timer‚Äù halts the countdown logic entirely.
- Ensured the display updates to show no time remaining when appropriate.

![Timer Reset Fix](docs/figures/gifs/timer-reset-fix.gif)  
*When starting a new game without a timer, any previous countdown now stops correctly, ensuring clean and clear game sessions.*

These changes ensured that each game session begins cleanly, regardless of the timer settings used in the previous round.

#### **4.5.3.b Board Overlap on different Screens**
On some mobile devices and rotated tablet screens, the Sudoku grid occasionally overlapped with the footer or was partially cut off, affecting usability and visual clarity.

In order to address this I: 
- Added min-height values within responsive media queries for different screen sizes and orientations.
- Ensured the game board, controls, and footer had adequate vertical breathing space.

![Overlap Fix](docs/figures/gifs/overlap-fix.gif)  
*Responsive min-height values ensure the board never overlaps the footer, maintaining visual clarity across all screen sizes.*

This fix prevents content from being squashed or hidden on smaller screens, making gameplay consistent across devices.

# **5. Feature Set**
This section highlights the complete functionality of **Codoku** in its final state, organized by the user journey. It covers everything from universal components to page-specific features and thoughtful enhancements. 

Each entry outlines what users can do, the benefits those features provide, and the technologies that power them. This helps both developers and users understand how the project works, what makes it accessible, and where it shines in terms of user experience and technical design.

## **5.1 Universal Features**
These features form the core structure of the **Codoku** website and are consistently available to all users throughout their experience.

### **5.1.1 Theme Toggle** 
The Theme Toggle permits users to switch between light and dark visual modes based on preference or ambient lighting conditions. It promotes accessibility and personalization by offering visually distinct styles for different contexts.

Users can select a soft, high-contrast light theme or a glare-reducing dark mode, making Codoku more usable across environments, from bright classrooms to late-night settings. This is done when you click or tap the switch labeled 'Display' in the navigation bar to toggle modes. Icons and label colors update dynamically to indicate the current state.

**Benefits**:
- Enhances usability for users in different lighting conditions.
- Supports user autonomy and personalization.
- Visually reinforces state changes with clear feedback (e.g. icon and toggle color shift).

![Theme Toggle Demo](docs/figures/gifs/theme-toggle.gif)  
*Theme toggle in action, toggling between light and dark UI modes.*

**Technical Aspects**:
- Uses `:root` `CSS` variables (`--color-bg-light`, `--color-bg-dark`, etc.) to define themable values
- A `.dark` class is toggled on the `<body>` tag.
- Background images and icon colors change conditionally using nested `CSS` selectors (`body.dark .nav-link`, `body.dark #grid p`, etc.)
- Toggle logic is handled via `theme.js`, which listens for changes on the `#theme-switch` input
  - Adds or removes the `dark` class from `<body>` to trigger theme shift
  - User preference is persisted with `localStorage`, ensuring the chosen theme remains consistent across sessions.
  - On page load, the stored theme preference is applied automatically to ensure consistency
- Styled toggle switch with accessible label for clarity.
  - Includes visible label 'Display' and icon (`fa-sun` / `fa-moon`) for users with varying abilities
  - Modal overlays, alerts, buttons, and input elements also adopt the current theme to ensure visual continuity
- If sound is enabled (`isSoundEnabled === true`), switching the theme triggers one of two brief, distinctive audio clips:
  - Light mode: 'Tweet'
  - Dark mode: 'Hoot'
  - Played using `soundEffects.play("tweet")` or `soundEffects.play("hoot")` inside the toggle logic using a ternary operator

### **5.1.2 Sound Toggle** 

The Sound Toggle is an accessibility-focused control that lets users mute or enable Codoku‚Äôs in-game sound effects. It enhances user autonomy and caters to sensory-sensitive individuals by ensuring all audio is opt-in. This toggle manages feedback sounds like clue activations, number selections, page changes, win animations, and errors. By default, sound is muted on first visit to support inclusive design. Users can click or tap the switch labeled 'Sound' in the navbar to toggle between muted and active states. Color and icon updates provide immediate visual feedback.

![Sound Toggle Demo](docs/figures/gifs/sound-toggle.gif)  
*Demonstration of the sound toggle controlling global audio state across the site.*

**Benefits**:
- Prevents unexpected or jarring sounds on page load.
- Offers sensory-friendly options for neurodivergent users or those in shared/quiet environments.
- Gives returning users a persistent setting tailored to their preference.

**Technical Aspects**:
- Built using a `Bootstrap` `form-switch` input and `<label>` for accessibility
- The icon (`fa-volume-xmark` or `fa-volume-high`) updates dynamically based on state in `applySoundSetting()`
- Visual feedback includes dynamic color changes via `.form-check-input` custom styles:  
  - üî¥ Red (Muted)  
  - üü¢ Green (Active)
- Toggle logic is handled via `sound.js`, which listens for changes on the `#sound-switch` input
  - The toggle listens for change events and updates a global boolean `isSoundEnabled` using a ternary operator
  - State is stored in `localStorage`, so user choice remains even after browser refresh or revisit.
- A global `soundEffects` object manages all sound files using HTML `<audio>` elements preloaded into memory
  - The `soundEffects.play()` method (used throughout game logic) respects the current toggle state to prevent unwanted playback
- `aria-label` and semantic form structure ensure screen reader compatibility
- Tightly coupled with all core game actions like `enableCellSelection()`, `revealHint()`, `startTimer()`, and `triggerAutoWinCheck()`

### **5.1.3 Navigation Bar**
A responsive, sticky top navigation panel that gives users immediate access to key areas of the **Codoku** website: the Game, About, and Rules pages. This feature ensures easy movement with embedded toggles for user preferences (theme and sound), and auto-collapses on mobile to maximize screen real estate. Users can click or tap page links directly, or open the hamburger menu on smaller devices. Toggle switches for Display (theme) and Sound are always accessible within the navbar.

![Navigation Bar in Action](docs/figures/gifs/navbar.gif)  
*Demonstration of the responsive navigation bar, complete with toggle collapse functionality and embedded display controls.*

**Benefits:**
- Provides quick access to core site areas from anywhere on the site
- Mobile-first design offers seamless navigation on phones and tablets
- Centralizes user preference controls (sound/theme toggles)
- Maintains user context with a persistent top-bar layout 

**Technical Aspects:**
- Responsive design
  - Built using the `Bootstrap 5` `navbar` component with `navbar-expand-lg` and collapse classes for fluid responsiveness.
  - On smaller viewports, the menu collapses into a hamburger toggler (`navbar-toggler`), controlled via `data-bs-toggle` and `data-bs-target`
- A custom function `setupNavLinkCollapse()` in `navbar.js` ensures that once a nav link is clicked on mobile, the dropdown menu auto-collapses for better UX. 
- Toggle Integrations
  - The theme and sound toggles are embedded within the navbar and use `<input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input">`.
  - Each toggle syncs with `localStorage` to persist user choices across sessions
  - Toggle icons and colors update based on theme or sound status in `theme.js` and `sound.js` and conditional use `CSS` classes
  - If sound toggle is set to unmuted, 'Hoot' and 'Tweet' sounds are played when the theme switch is toggled
- Accessibility Enhancements
  - ARIA attributes like `aria-label` and `aria-controls` ensure the menu is screen reader-friendly.
- The navbar inherits background images that match the current theme (`nav-light-background.webp` or `nav-dark-background.webp`), maintaining stylistic continuity across the site.
  - These backgrounds have a transparent bottom to create a fade when users scroll down on a page.

### 5.1.4 Rules Modal
The rules modal is an accessible pop-up interface that presents the game rules in a concise, readable format using modal design patterns. It delivers game instructions in a way that doesn‚Äôt interrupt flow or require a separate page load. It educates users while keeping them immersed in the puzzle interface. Users open the modal by clicking 'Rules'‚Äù' in the navbar. It can be dismissed via a clearly labeled 'Back ‚Ü≤' button. 

![Rules Modal Preview](docs/figures/gifs/rules-modal.gif)  
*The rules modal explains the **Codoku** objective and user controls directly within the game view.*

**Benefits:**
- Offers clear gameplay guidance in a non-intrusive format  
- Prevents user disorientation by avoiding page changes  
- Styled to match light/dark themes for visual consistency  

**Technical Aspects:**
- Built with `Bootstrap`
  - Implemented using `Bootstrap`‚Äôs `.modal` structure with `data-bs-toggle="modal"` and `data-bs-target` bindings.
  - `tabindex="-1"` and ARIA attributes (`aria-labelledby`, `aria-hidden`) improve keyboard navigation and screen reader announcements.
- Uses semantic `HTML` to ensure proper reading order and landmark tagging for assistive technologies
  - `<section>`, `<ul>`, `<p>` for structural clarity
  - `<legend>` and `<button>` for accessible form navigation
- Inherits the same font families and border styles (`modal-border`) to maintain design consistency.

### 5.1.5 Sticky Footer

The sticky footer is a persistent feature that appears at the bottom of every page in **Codoku**, displaying key external links and branding. Users can click icons to visit external pages and view site ownership information.

![Sticky Footer Preview](docs/figures/gifs/footer.gif)  
*The sticky footer remains fixed across pages, offering quick access to external links and consistent branding.*

**Benefits:**
- Ensures users can easily navigate to external resources like social media  
- Displays copyright and site identity for user trust  
- Footer icons enhance visual interest and recognizability  

**Technical Aspects:**
- Implemented using `CSS` Flexbox for alignment
  - The footer uses a Flexbox `container` to horizontally distribute social icons and copyright.
  - It is styled with `flex-shrink: 0` to ensure it doesn't collapse and placed at the bottom via layout-driven `min-height` strategy in the `<body>`
- Media queries scale up font and icon sizes on larger viewports

- Social icons sourced from Font Awesome, included via CDN for performance and scalability.
- `:hover` effects slightly enlarge icons and change their color for feedback
- All anchor elements include `aria-label`s for screen reader context (e.g., 'Facebook')
- External links use `target="_blank"` for safe access in new tabs   

## **5.2 Game Features**
The game page is the interactive core of **Codoku**, where users engage with the Sudoku puzzle. This section reviews the features users experience from the moment gameplay begins, from puzzle setup through to feedback, interactivity, and win conditions.

Each feature below contributes to a smoother, more enjoyable, and responsive gameplay experience.

### **5.2.1 Setup Modal**
This is an introductory modal that configures difficulty and timer settings before gameplay begins. It streamlines user onboarding and ensures the game starts with a known configuration, acting as a game settings section. This modal appears on first load, upon pressing 'New', and after puzzle completion. Users select options and click 'Enter' to begin. After first game is played, a 'Cancel' button becomes visible to players. 

![Setup modal preview](docs/figures/gifs/setup-modal.gif)
*User configuring difficulty and timer settings before starting a game in **Codoku***

**Benefits:**
- Provides clarity on starting the game  
- Prevents unintentional gameplay without selected preferences  
- Improves UX by offering visual onboarding  

**Technical Aspects:**
- `Bootstrap` modal launched via `setupModal.show()` on page load or restart.
- Implemented using `Bootstrap`‚Äôs modal component with `data-bs-backdrop="static"` and no keyboard dismissal to enforce attention.
- Uses custom styling for accessibility and theme matching.
- The Cancel button is programmatically hidden (`display: none`) on first load using `JavaScript` and only becomes visible on subsequent visits, making the setup modal mandatory on initial page load.
- Difficulty and time selections are captured from radio inputs inside the modal form.
- `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements used for grouped settings (timer and difficulty).
- Upon pressing 'Enter ‚Ü≤', selections are validated and passed to the game logic via startNewGame(), which triggers puzzle fetching, timer initialization, and stat panel updates.
- Modal aesthetics dynamically match theme mode (light/dark) using `CSS` class switching.
- If a game has not yet been played (`hasPlayed === false`), the Cancel button is hidden on load with `$('#cancel-button').hide()`.
- Once a game has started, `hasPlayed` is set to `true`, and future modal triggers will show the Cancel button, giving users freedom to abandon setup later.

### **5.2.2 Sudoku Puzzle Generation**
Sudoku puzzles are dynamically generated based on the user‚Äôs selected difficulty level. It enables players to play unique puzzles every session. The generated board is validated and complete, avoiding repetition. 

Upon starting a game from the setup modal, the board is rendered with a mix of fixed (numbered) and editable (empty) cells. 

![Generated puzzle preview](docs/figures/gifs/puzzle-generation.gif)  
*After confirming settings, **Codoku** dynamically fetches and renders a Sudoku puzzle from the API.*

**Benefits:**
- Offers replayability with randomized puzzle boards  
- Encourages continued play across difficulty levels  
- Prevents repetition or pattern memorization  

**Technical Aspects:**
- Uses the `/v1/sudokugenerate` endpoint from API Ninjas
  - Parameters: `difficulty` (easy, medium, hard); defaults to ‚Äúmedium‚Äù
  - Method: `GET` with secure `X-Api-Key` in headers
  - Monthly quota: 10,000 API calls
- AJAX logic built with `$.ajax()` (`jQuery`) retrieves puzzle and solution from the response
- The response is destructured (`const { puzzle, solution }`) for internal use
- The `renderEmptyGrid()` function dynamically creates the `HTML` grid
- `populateGrid()` maps the puzzle data to the board:
  - Fixed cells get `.generated` and `fw-bold` styling
  - Empty cells are tagged `.editable` and made interactive via `enableCellSelection()`
- Each puzzle has a matching solution stored in `currentSolution` for live validation
- Failover handling: displays error in the console if the API fails
- A fallback message or retry logic is included if the API returns an error, ensuring a smooth UX.

### **5.2.3 Grid Interaction System**
This feature creates a live sudoku board where players are able to input numbers using mouse, touchscreen or keyboard. This feature specifically enables cell selection and number-only user inputs for interactive puzzle solving. Users can engage with this feature with a mouse to hover over editable cells, clicking on one to select it and then entering numbers via keyboard or tapping on number buttons in the numbers container. Users can clear entries with the 'Delete' or 'Backspace' keyboard button or ‚å´ button. 

![Grid interaction preview](docs/figures/gifs/grid-interaction.gif)  
*Players interact with the Sudoku board in **Codoku** via keyboard or on-screen buttons to input or clear numbers.*

**Benefits:**
- Enhances accessibility with multi-input support  
- Allows both mouse and keyboard control  
- Supports cell highlighting for better spatial awareness  

**Technical Aspects:**
- Each `<p>` tag representing a cell includes `data-row` and `data-col` attributes for logical mapping.
- `CSS` Classes & Visual Feedback:
  - `.editable`: Marks cells the user can interact with.
  - `.selected`: Highlights the currently focused cell (yellow for day mode/blue for night mode).
  - Hover states (blue for day mode/yellow for night mode) and pointer styles are managed using `:hover` selectors and `jQuery` `.hover()` logic.
- `enableCellSelection()` binds event listeners to all `.editable` cells.
- Click events use `.on('click')` to assign `.selected` and set `selectedCell`
- Keyboard events are globally captured with `document.on('keydown')`:
  - `1‚Äì9`: Inserts the number into the selected cell
  - `Backspace` / `Delete`: Clears the cell
- On-screen number buttons are `<h2>` elements, bound via `.on('click')` to populate the selected cell.
- Rules Modal instructions explain interaction steps clearly.
- All interactive elements use standard `HTML` or `ARIA`-compliant components.
- JS directly modifies the class lists (`classList.add/remove`) and inline styles (`style.cursor`) for state transitions.

### **5.2.4 Check Button**
This is a user activated button that verifies their current board inputs. It gives feedback on whether entries are incorrect. When the user presses 'Check' at any point, errors are highlighted in red, correct entries stay the same.  

![Check button usage preview](docs/figures/gifs/check-button.gif)   
*Incorrect entries are marked in red after validation.*

**Benefits:**
- Encourages learning and error correction  
- Reduces frustration by offering non-final feedback  
- Prevents accidental incorrect submission  

**Technical Aspects:**
- Tied to the `check-button` ID in the DOM and bound via `jQuery`‚Äôs `.on('click')` inside `DOMContentLoaded`
- Calls the `checkUserInput()` function:
  - Iterates through each `.editable` cell using `jQuery`‚Äôs `.each()`
  - Fetches its coordinates via `data-row` and `data-col` attributes
  - Compares content against `currentSolution[][]` for accuracy
  - Adds `.incorrect` class (`CSS`-colored red) if mismatched; removes it otherwise
- Increments `hintsUsed` and updates the display using `updateHintsDisplay()`
- Triggers sound feedback via `soundEffects.play("hint")` to reinforce interaction if sound is toggled on
- Designed not to alter empty or untouched cells‚Äîerrors only appear where input exists
- Impacts the logic of `triggerAutoWinCheck()` ‚Äî heavily hinted completions show an alternate win modal

### **5.2.5 Clue Button**
This feature provides a single correct number in a random empty cell. It helps users to move forward in the game when stuck, without providing the solution to the whole puzzle. When a user clicks the 'Clue' button, it reveals one cell answer. 

![Clue button usage preview](docs/figures/gifs/clue-button.gif)   
*A correct number is revealed in a blank cell and colored green.*

**Benefits:**
- Assists new players without giving away full solutions  
- Allows strategic help for difficult puzzles  
- Increases accessibility for casual users  

**Technical Aspects:**
- Binds to the `hint-button` ID in the DOM using `jQuery` `.on('click')` within `DOMContentLoaded` 
- Calls the `revealHint()` function:
  - Scans `.editable` cells for blanks (`.text().trim() === ""`)
  - Selects one at random using `Math.random()` 
  - Retrieves the correct value from `currentSolution[row][col]`
  - Inserts the value directly and applies `.hinted` class for green-styled visual cue
- Hints are not replayed or stacked, once revealed, cells are marked and preserved
- Updates `hintsUsed` and reflects count via `updateHintsDisplay()`
- Impacts the logic of `triggerAutoWinCheck()`, heavily hinted completions show an alternate win modal

### **5.2.6 Optional Game Timer**
This is a countdown timer feature that is configurable at the beginning of each game in the Setup Modal. This adds a time constraint for an increased challenge. User's interact with this feature by selecting a time limit or 'None' for no countdown. The timer then counds down visibly in the game stats panel. 

![Game timer preview](docs/figures/gifs/game-timer.gif)  
*Timer counts down visibly while the puzzle is being solved.*

When the player runs out of time, an alert modal is triggered with alarm sound and the board is disabled from further interaction. 

![Timeout modal preview](docs/figures/gifs/timeout-trigger.gif)  
*Puzzle filled incorrectly triggers visual and auditory feedback.*

**Benefits:**
- Adds time-based challenge for competitive or advanced play  
- Creates tension and urgency, mimicking real-time puzzles  
- Optional for casual users  

**Technical Aspects:**
- Timer logic handled by `startTimer()`:
  - Parses the user‚Äôs time selection from `$('input[name="time"]:checked').val()`
  - Initializes countdown using `setInterval()` and stores reference in `countdownInterval`
- `updateTimerDisplay()` formats seconds to `MM:SS` using `Math.floor()` and `padStart()`
- On timeout, `endGameDueToTime()` is triggered:
  - Plays a preloaded `alarm` sound if sound toggle is on
  - Locks the board (`.editable` cells disabled via `pointer-events: none`)
  - Displays a Timeout modal 
- Countdown is paused or cleared with `clearInterval()` on:
  - Win condition
  - Manual restart via the Setup Modal
- Timer label is dynamically injected into `timer` id in the stats panel using `jQuery`
- State logic ensures timer resets correctly between sessions (fixes applied based on user feedback)

### **5.2.7 Error Detection on Filled Puzzle**
This feature is a built in safeguard for accuracy when the sudoku grid is fully filled by the user but not correctly solved. **Codoku** detects the mismatch and gives immediate, constructive feedback.

![Error modal preview](docs/figures/gifs/error.gif)  
*If the board is full but incorrect an error sound and modal will appear.*

Benefits:
- Prevents accidental false completion
- Offers gentle correction without revealing the solution
- Keeps the challenge intact while providing helpful feedback

Technical Aspects: 
- The system continuously monitors game state via the `triggerAutoWinCheck()` function. This is called:
  - After every valid cell input (keyboard or tap)
  - After use of the 'Check' or 'Clue' buttons
- Conditions checked:
  - `isBoardFilled()` 
    - Uses `jQuery` to collect all `.editable` cells
    - Checks each one for non-empty `textContent`
    - Returns `true` only if all user-input cells are filled
  - `isBoardCompleteAndCorrect()` 
    - Iterates each editable cell and compares its value to the matching value in `currentSolution`, which was stored at the time of board generation
    - If all values match, the board is considered solved
- If `isBoardFilled()` returns `true` but `isBoardCompleteAndCorrect()` returns `false`
  - A friendly `Bootstrap` modal (`#alert-modal`) is triggered using `bootstrap.Modal.show()`:
    - üîç Try again! It looks like there's an error somewhere!
  - An `<audio>` element (`#error-sound`) is included in the `HTML` and preloaded
  - No cells are locked or penalized‚Äîusers can immediately begin fixing their entries

### **5.2.8 Win Detection System**
This feature detects when the puzzle is solved correctly and celebrates the win with feedback, sound and a summary modal. When all user input cells match the solution, Codoku displays a Congratulations modal with game stats and visual affects (confetti and applause if sound is toggled on). 

![Congrats modal preview](docs/figures/gifs/game-win.gif)  
*If a player completes the puzzle without using too many hints, a congratulations modal will appear with confetti and applause.*

If hints were used heavily an alternate Hinted Win modal provides a different message without celebration effects encouraging the user to be more independent in their puzzle solving. 

![Hinted win modal preview](docs/figures/gifs/hinted-win.gif)  
*If a player completes the puzzle but uses too many hints an alternate hinted win modal will appear.*

**Benefits:**
- Offers clear, rewarding feedback at the end of a game
- Confirms completion through visual and auditory cues
- Adapts messaging based on clue usage, reinforcing user effort
- Encourages replay with challenge-based encouragement

**Technical Aspects:**
- Win logic handled by `triggerAutoWinCheck()`:
  - Runs after each valid cell input or clue insertion
  - Tied to `isBoardFilled()` to confirm grid completion
  - If `true`, it then confirms correctness via `isBoardCompleteAndCorrect()` by comparing each user entry against `currentSolution`
- Based on hint usage different outcomes occur:
  - If the board is complete and few or no hints were used:
    - A visual celebration is triggered by the `popConfetti()` function, which uses the Canvas-Confetti library to render falling confetti in the center of the screen.
    - The sound effect `applause` is played using `soundEffects.play("applause")`, a modular system controlling audio playback.
    - The standard win modal (`#congrats-modal`) is opened using `Bootstrap`‚Äôs JS API (`bootstrap.Modal.show()`).
    - The player stats are dynamically inserted using `jQuery` DOM manipulation.
  - If the user relied heavily on hints (e.g. more hint cells than user-filled cells):
    - A different modal (`#hinted-win-modal`) is shown instead, displaying a more encouraging message.
    - Stats are again filled dynamically using `jQuery` selectors, but the tone of messaging shifts to emphasize future improvement.
- Regardless of win type:
  - The game timer is cleared (`clearInterval(countdownInterval)`) to prevent it from running after win state.
  - A `hasCelebrated` flag ensures the modal and effects are only triggered once per game session.
  - The win modal contains options to start a new game or admire the finished puzzle.

### **5.2.8 Stats Panel**
This feature displays live, non-interactive information about the game: current difficulty, countdown timer (if active), and hints used. It is located directly above the puzzle grid and helps users stay informed about their progress and game settings. It has a read-only display and keeps players oriented by showing real-time updates that reflect user actions and setup choices. Users interact with this feature indirectly as changes to the stats panel occur as a result of player inputs or events such as starting a new game, setting the difficulty and timer, pressing 'Clue' or 'Check' and timer counting down every second (if enabled). 

![Stats panel preview](docs/figures/gifs/stats-panel.gif)  
*Live panel updates during gameplay, reflecting selected difficulty, time and number of hints used.*

**Benefits:**
- Keeps players informed of current settings and progress  
- Enhances engagement by displaying useful metrics  
- Reinforces feedback when using hint/check features by updating the hint count
- Promotes replay with visible challenge conditions  

**Technical Aspects:**
- The panel updates are handled by specific helper functions that manipulate the DOM directly using `jQuery`:
  - `updateDifficultyDisplay()` ‚Äì triggered on game start
  - `updateTimerDisplay()` ‚Äì runs once per second using `setInterval()`
  - `updateHintsDisplay()` ‚Äì updates after each clue or check
- When a new game begins (`startNewGame()`): 
  - The timer is reset or disabled depending on the player‚Äôs selection.
  - The hint count is reset to zero, and the display is updated accordingly.
- Each stat is tied to a unique ID (`#difficulty`, `#timer`, `#hints`) allowing targeted, efficient updates without querying the whole DOM.
- The player‚Äôs setup selections (`<input name="difficulty">` and `<input name="time">`) are read and used to determine:
  - Text content (e.g., ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù, ‚ÄúTimer: 3:00‚Äù)
  - Whether to show a static ‚ÄúTimer: None‚Äù label or dynamic countdown
- Stats values are passed directly into the Congratulations and Hinted Win modals using
  - `#congrats-difficulty`, `#congrats-time`, `#congrats-hints`
  - `#hinted-difficulty`, `#hinted-time`, `#hinted-hints`
- Font sizes and layout spacing scale across breakpoints using media queries (`.game-stat` class) to maintain readability on all devices.

## **6. Testing**

Thorough testing was conducted to ensure that the Codoku game functions reliably, is accessible to a wide range of users, and performs well across devices and browsers. This process involved a combination of automated tools and manual testing techniques to validate the code, check for accessibility compliance, assess performance, and confirm that all features behave as expected.

Key testing areas include:
- Code validation
- Accessibility testing 
- Performance Testing
- Responsiveness and Cross-Browser Compatibility
- User Stories and Feature Functionality

Testing was a continuous and multi-faceted process throughout the development of Codoku, ensuring a stable, accessible, and user-friendly experience. A combination of automated tools and manual techniques were employed to evaluate code quality, accessibility, performance, responsiveness, and feature reliability.

Across all pages (`index.html`, `about.html`, `404.html`), `HTML` and `CSS` passed validation after iterative refinements, while `JavaScript` was modular, clean, and passed linting with only minor contextual warnings. Accessibility conformance was verified against WCAG 2.2 using multiple tools, confirming semantic structure, ARIA usage, keyboard operability, and screen reader support. A 100% accessibility score was achieved across all Lighthouse, Axe, and AccessibilityChecker audits.

Performance testing highlighted high scores on desktop (96‚Äì100) and strong mobile scores (75‚Äì94), with optimizations applied to defer scripts, preload LCP images, compress assets, and improve layout stability. Responsive design was confirmed through emulation, BrowserStack, and real-device feedback from 12 users across phones, tablets, and desktops, all reporting a functional, adaptive interface.

A detailed usability survey guided structured testing of 20+ interactive features, including theme and sound toggles, puzzle logic, stats tracking, navigation, accessibility modals, and error handling. Each feature was tested against specific user stories and acceptance criteria, with feedback captured through yes/no questions and optional comments. Testers who encountered unexpected results were encouraged to provide contextual insights.

Overall, Codoku performed reliably and consistently across devices and browsers. Minor enhancements (e.g., stronger visual cues, better mobile contrast, and full keyboard cell navigation) were identified as future improvement areas. The project meets high standards of accessibility, user-centered design, and performance, backed by thorough testing and real user feedback.

For a full breakdown of all testing processes, tools used, and results, please refer to this [TESTING](docs/TESTING.md) document.

# **7. Bugs and Fixes**  
Throughout the development of Codoku, various issues surfaced across functionality, styling, accessibility, validation, and performance. These were resolved through a combination of real-time testing, research, accessibility audits, and peer feedback.

Each issue is outlined with a breakdown of what went wrong, its cause, consequence, what research informed the fix, and how it was resolved. While not every single bug or tweak is listed, as would be unrealistic for any development project, I‚Äôve selected issues that stood out for their learning value. These include both common pitfalls and more complex challenges I was proud to overcome. This selection reflects my growth as a developer and the thoughtful problem-solving that shaped the final product.

## **7.1 Functional Issues**  
Functional issues refer to problems that affected how core features of the **Codoku** game and site operated. These bugs typically impacted the logic, interactivity, and behavior of the application, such as how the puzzle grid responded, how the timer worked, how audio was controlled, and how the game reset conditions were triggered. Resolving these issues was essential to ensure a smooth, intuitive, and bug-free experience for the user. Each fix aimed to reinforce correct state management, predictable responses to user input, and a seamless gameplay loop from start to finish.

### **7.1.1. Grid Still Active After Puzzle Solved**  
During development, I noticed that even after solving the puzzle, users were still able to click on the grid and input new numbers. This undermined the sense of completion and allowed players to accidentally overwrite correct answers, making the win feel unfinished.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- The grid cells kept their `editable` class even after the puzzle was completed.
- Event listeners and pointer interactivity remained active.
- There was no formal locking mechanism tied to the game‚Äôs win condition.

**How I Solved It:**  
To address this, I created a dedicated `disablePuzzleInteraction()` function. This function loops through every cell marked as `editable` and:

- Removes the `editable` class.
- Sets `pointer-events: none` to block mouse input.
- Adds `aria-disabled="true"` and `tabindex="-1"` for accessibility and keyboard lockout.
- Uses `.prop('disabled', true)` for consistency, even though `<p>` elements don‚Äôt require it.

This function is triggered when the user clicks ‚ÄúAdmire Puzzle‚Äù after completing the game, allowing players to celebrate their win without modifying the board.

**Reference Materials:**   
- [MDN: pointer-events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events)
- [WAI-ARIA: aria-disabled](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/)
- [Stack Overflow: How to disable and then enable onclick event on <div> with javascript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18982642)

**The Result:**  
Once the puzzle is solved, players can no longer interact with the grid. This preserves the final state, avoids accidental edits, and enhances both the accessibility and polish of the win experience.

### **7.1.2. Error Modal Triggered Game Reset**  
While testing incorrect input scenarios, I noticed that the error modal, intended to give players feedback on mistakes, was inadvertently restarting the game. This was especially frustrating for users who wanted to return to the board and fix their errors without losing progress.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- A single handler controlled the "OK" button in the alert modal, regardless of context.
- The game logic did not distinguish between different alert types, so the reset modal logic was applied universally, including for standard input errors.

**How I Solved It:**  
To fix this, I rewrote the logic for the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button inside the `DOMContentLoaded` event. I used `textContent` to check the actual message shown in the alert modal. If the message contained the phrase ‚ÄúTime‚Äôs up,‚Äù then the game logic triggered the setup modal and hid the cancel button. Otherwise, it simply dismissed the alert without resetting the game or altering the board.

This approach let me maintain a single modal element for all alerts while applying different behaviors based on the message content. Console logs helped confirm that only the timeout scenario triggered a game restart.

**Reference Materials:**  
- [Bootstrap 5 Modal JavaScript API](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/#via-javascript)
- [Stack Overflow: Check if there's some text inside an element](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28327989)

**The Result:**  
Error feedback is now cleanly separated from game resets. Players can receive input-related alerts and return to the puzzle without losing progress, while time-based alerts still guide the player back to the setup screen as intended.

### **7.1.3. Timer Did Not Reset Properly**  
While testing multiple rounds of the game, I discovered that the timer sometimes continued running after a game ended or overlapped with a new session. In certain cases, the countdown appeared to speed up or run multiple instances at once, disrupting the experience.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- The global `countdownInterval` was not consistently cleared before starting a new game.
- As a result, `setInterval()` created multiple timers on top of each other, which caused desynchronization and unexpected countdown behavior.

**How I Solved It:**  
Instead of isolating the timer into a self-contained module, I opted for a globally scoped `countdownInterval` variable to track the current instance. I added a check at the start of `startTimer()` to clear any existing intervals before creating a new one:

This ensures that only one timer is active at any given time. I then converted the user‚Äôs selected time from minutes to seconds, stored it in timeRemaining, and used setInterval() to update the display every second. When the countdown reached zero, the interval cleared and the game ended with an alert modal and optional alarm sound.

**Reference Materials:**  
- [Stack Overflow: Clear and reset JavaScript interval](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57860947)
- [MDN: setInterval() & clearInterval()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval)
- [Vaidehi Joshi: The Final Countdown](https://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/01/06/the-final-countdown-using-javascripts-setinterval-plus-clearinterval-methods/)

**The Result:**  
The timer now initializes cleanly on every new game, runs exactly once, and updates reliably without overlapping. It gracefully ends the game when time runs out and resets properly with each new puzzle, supporting both timed and untimed play modes.

### **7.1.4. Sounds Played When Muted**  
Even after toggling the mute setting, users reported that game sounds‚Äîsuch as tap effects, key presses, and applause‚Äîcontinued to play. This was especially disruptive in quiet environments and created a poor user experience.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- Although a mute toggle was present, the logic to control sound playback was scattered across the codebase.
- Individual `audio.play()` calls did not check the user's mute preference.
- The `isSoundEnabled` flag was not being referenced where sounds were triggered.

**How I Solved It:**  
Instead of checking `isSoundEnabled` at every single sound trigger, I centralized all sound playback inside a `soundEffects.play(name)` function. This wrapper function:

- Accepts a sound name like `"key"` or `"applause"`.
- Checks whether `isSoundEnabled` is `true`.
- Resets the current audio‚Äôs `currentTime` to `0` before calling `.play()` to ensure sounds can replay rapidly.
- Gracefully skips playback if the mute toggle is active.

This change made the audio system easier to maintain and guaranteed consistent behavior across all parts of the app. The structure was modeled after techniques used in modular game development and audio best practices from MDN and Stack Overflow.

**Reference Materials:**  
- [Stack Overflow: JavaScript Audio Play on click](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18826147)
- [MDN: Audio.play()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/play)

**The Result:**  
All game sounds now respect the mute setting. When the toggle is off, no audio is played from any event‚Äîcreating a quieter, more accessible, and user-friendly experience across all devices.

### **7.1.5. Navbar Didn‚Äôt Collapse on Link Click**  
On mobile devices, the Bootstrap navbar would stay open after a navigation link was clicked, covering page content and confusing users who expected it to close.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- Bootstrap‚Äôs collapsible navbar does not automatically close on link interaction.
- Manual control using `.collapse('hide')` or API access is required.

**How I Solved It:**  
I found the relevant section in the [Bootstrap 5 Navbar documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/#how-it-works), which confirmed that the collapse component must be controlled programmatically.

I then used `Bootstrap.Collapse.getInstance(navbar).hide()` inside each nav link‚Äôs event listener. Console testing confirmed the collapse component was correctly initialized.

**The Result:**    
The navbar now collapses immediately after a user selects a link, greatly improving usability on small screens.

### **7.1.5. Navbar Didn‚Äôt Collapse on Link Click**  
While testing Codoku on smaller screens, I noticed that the mobile navigation menu remained open after a user clicked a link. This led to a frustrating experience where the expanded navbar covered page content and made the interface feel unresponsive or broken.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- Bootstrap‚Äôs collapsible navbar component doesn‚Äôt automatically close when a nav link is clicked.
- By default, it requires explicit JavaScript instructions to trigger a `.hide()` event on the navbar collapse instance.
- The expected behavior‚Äîauto-collapsing after selection‚Äîneeds to be implemented manually.

**How I Solved It:**  
After reviewing the Bootstrap 5 Navbar documentation, I learned that Bootstrap‚Äôs `Collapse` provides a programmatic way to hide elements. I used jQuery to target all nav links and attached a click event listener to each one. Inside the handler, I retrieved the current instance of the navbar collapse component using:

```javascript
const bsCollapse = bootstrap.Collapse.getInstance(document.getElementById('navbarNav'));
bsCollapse.hide();
```
This ensured that whenever a link was clicked, the mobile menu would close as expected. Console testing confirmed that the collapse component was correctly detected and controlled.

**Reference Materials:**  
- [Bootstrap 5 Navbar Collapse Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/collapse/)
- [jQuery .on() Documentation](https://api.jquery.com/on/)

**The Result:**  
The mobile navbar now collapses smoothly after a link is selected. This significantly improves the navigation experience on small screens and aligns with user expectations for responsive design behavior.

### **7.1.6. Incomplete Reset on New Game**
During development and testing, it became clear that the hint counter was not always resetting properly between games. Players who used hints during one session would sometimes see the old hint count persist when starting a new puzzle. This undermined the game‚Äôs fairness, especially for users trying to track progress or improve over time.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- The hint counter (`hintsUsed`) was working but the `#hints` display was not reset in all game start scenarios in the display.
- Fragmented logic across `game.js` and `setup-modal.js` made it easy to miss this state variable during initialization.

**How I Solved It:**  
I consolidated all reset-related functionality into a dedicated `startNewGame()` function inside `game.js`. Within this function, I ensured:
- `hintsUsed` is explicitly reset to 0.
- The hints display (`#hints`) is updated in the DOM.
- The counter is cleared before any new game logic runs.
```javascript
function startNewGame() {
    ...
    hintsUsed = 0;
    updateHintsDisplay();
    ...
}
```
This function is triggered via the startNewGame() call in setup-modal.js once a user completes the setup form:
```javascript
function setupStartButton() {
  ...
  startButton.addEventListener("click", function () {
      const setupModal = $("#setup-modal");
      const setupModalBootstrap = bootstrap.Modal.getInstance(setupModal[0]);
      if (setupModalBootstrap) {
          setupModalBootstrap.hide();
      }
      startNewGame();
  });
}
```
**Reference Materials:**  
- [Stack Overflow: How to reset everything in my javascript game](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63126904)

**The Result:**  
The hint counter now reliably resets with each new game, preventing carry-over errors and ensuring players start fresh. This change improves consistency, fairness, and the professional polish of the Codoku gameplay experience.

## **7.2 Styling & Layout Issues**  
Styling issues in Codoku mostly centered around ensuring responsiveness, dark mode compatibility, modal clarity, and visual consistency across devices. These challenges were resolved directly in the `style.css` file using a combination of custom variables, layered selectors, and media queries.

#### **7.2.1. Grid Overflowed on Small Screens**  
On small devices, the Sudoku grid often exceeded the width or height of the viewport, causing horizontal scrollbars and awkward alignment.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- Fixed cell size values set out in `game.js` didn't scale to smaller screen dimensions.
- Grid was absolutely positioned and centered via transforms, which ignored natural document flow.

**How I Solved It:**
I defined a base `--cell-size` in `:root`, and then used targeted `@media` queries to redefine it at specific breakpoints:
```css
@media screen and (min-width: 280px) and (min-height: 479px) {
  :root {
    --cell-size: 30px;
  }
}
```
I also reset the grid‚Äôs layout from `absolute` to static in this smallest breakpoint to remove transform issues:
```css
#grid {
  position: static;
  transform: none;
  top: auto;
  left: auto;
}
```
**Reference Materials:**  
- [MDN: CSS Variables (--cell-size)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*)
- [MDN: CSS Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)

**The Result:**  
The grid now responsively resizes and repositions cleanly across breakpoints, ensuring accessibility and usability on all devices without horizontal scrolling.

### **7.2.2. Toggle Thumb Duplicated in Dark Mode**  
When switching to dark mode, theme and sound toggles sometimes showed a duplicated white ‚Äúthumb‚Äù over the native switch.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- The thumb was rendered using a custom `::before` pseudo-element.
- It was applied unconditionally, regardless of whether the toggle was focused or not.

**How I Solved It:**  
Inspired by custom toggle designs on Stack Overflow, I updated the dark mode toggle rule to conditionally apply only when not focused:
```css
body.dark #theme-toggle .form-check-input[type="checkbox"]:not(:focus)::before {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  background-color: white;
}
```
I repeated the same fix for the sound toggle using `:not(:checked):not(:focus)` for mute mode.

**Reference Materials:**  
- [Stack Overflow: Switch Styling with ::before](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57224537)

**The Result:**  
The toggles now transition cleanly between states with no visual artifacts, creating a polished look in both light and dark modes.

### **7.2.3. Modal Content Too Wide on Mobile**
Some modal windows, particularly the rules and congratulations modals, overflowed on narrow viewports.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- Modal padding and font sizes were static and didn‚Äôt adapt to screen width.
- Fixed margin values contributed to horizontal overflow.

**How I Solved It:**  
I used responsive `font-size` declarations and adjusted modal container styles:
```css
#rules-modal .modal-content {
  margin: 1rem;
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
}
```
I also applied background images with `background-size: cover` and removed borders that caused unnecessary visual bloat on mobile.

**Reference Materials:**  
- [MDN: overflow-wrap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-wrap)
- [Bootstrap Modals Best Practices](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/modal/)

**The Result:**  
Modals now look well-balanced and readable across devices, with wrapped text and responsive margins ensuring clean display.

### **7.2.4. Game Stats Panel Overlapped Grid Elements**

On devices with shorter screen heights (e.g., landscape phones or small tablets), the game stats panel occasionally overlapped the Sudoku grid, making it difficult to see or interact with bottom cells.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- The layout lacked adaptive spacing for vertical stacking in constrained viewports.
- The grid was absolutely positioned using `top: 50%` with `transform: translate`, which didn't account for elements positioned above it.
- No vertical margin or push space was provided to accommodate the game stats panel.

**How I Solved It:**  
I restructured the page layout using Flexbox and applied targeted media queries to reposition the grid when vertical space was limited:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 280px) and (min-height: 479px) and (orientation: portrait) {
  #grid {
    position: static;
    top: auto;
    left: auto;
    transform: none;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
  }
}
```
This allowed the grid to appear below the game stats panel in a natural document flow on squat screens, avoiding visual collisions.

**Reference:**  
- Layout advice for this issue was provided by my mentor, [David Bowers](https://github.com/dnlbowers).

**The Result:**  
The Sudoku grid is now always fully visible on all screen sizes. On shorter screens, the grid flows beneath the game stats panel, improving accessibility and gameplay clarity.

### **7.2.5. Theming Conflicts Between Light and Dark Modes**  
Some UI components retained light styles after switching to dark mode, breaking visual consistency.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- Not all components were properly scoped under the `body.dark` selector.
- Some elements relied on hardcoded color values instead of CSS variables.
- Certain buttons and modals were unaffected by dark mode due to static Bootstrap classes.

**How I Solved It:**  
I rewrote all theming styles using `body.dark` scoping in combination with CSS variables:

```css
body.dark .modal-content {
  background-color: var(--color-bg-dark);
  background-image: url(../backgrounds/dark-background-modal.webp);
}
```
To further enhance visual consistency, I added JavaScript logic in theme.js to dynamically update the Bootstrap button styles when toggling themes. I selected key UI buttons and used .`removeClass()` and `.addClass()` to switch between `.btn-dark` and `.btn-light`:
```javascript
themeButtons.forEach($btn => {
  if ($btn.length) {
    $btn.removeClass("btn-light btn-dark");
    $btn.addClass(isLightMode ? "btn-dark" : "btn-light");
  }
});
```
This ensured that even buttons outside modal or navbar contexts would update their appearance instantly and consistently during a theme switch.

**Reference Materials:**  
- [MDN: CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*)
- [Whitep4nth3r: Theming with CSS Variables](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/best-light-dark-mode-theme-toggle-javascript/)
- [freeCodeCamp: JavaScript Array forEach Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-array-foreach-tutorial-how-to-iterate-through-elements-in-an-array-with-map/)

**The Result:**  
Theme toggling is now fully consistent and polished across all elements, including buttons, modals, toggles, and navigation components. The dark and light modes retain contrast, legibility, and aesthetic clarity while honoring user preferences across sessions.

## **7.3 Accessibility Issues**  
Accessibility issues in Codoku primarily surfaced during manual keyboard navigation, screen reader testing, and HTML validation. These problems involved missing ARIA attributes, poor focus management, and lack of descriptive labels‚Äîeach of which could hinder users relying on assistive technologies. Below is a breakdown of the most significant accessibility challenges encountered and how they were resolved through research, testing, and iterative refinement.

### **7.3.1. Modals Not Announced by Screen Readers**  
During testing with VoiceOver, I found that screen readers were not reliably announcing modal content, making them difficult or impossible to use without sight.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- Missing or incorrect `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`, or modal role attributes.
- Modal sections didn‚Äôt clearly define landmarks or provide readable titles for assistive tech.

**How I Solved It:**  
Each modal was updated with the proper ARIA attributes, and descriptive hidden headings were added for better screen reader flow:
- `role="dialog"` or `aria-modal="true"` to mark them as interactive popups.
- Unique `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` references to titles and body text.
- Hidden `<h2>` headings inside each modal for additional semantic clarity.

For example:
```html
<section id="setup-modal" class="modal fade" tabindex="-1"
  aria-labelledby="setup-modal-label"
  aria-describedby="setup-modal-content"
  aria-hidden="true">
  <h2 class="d-none">Setup Modal</h2>
```
**Reference Materials:**
- [WAI-ARIA Dialog Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/)
- [MDN: ARIA Modal Best Practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/dialog_role)

**The Result:**
Modals are now properly announced and described when opened, providing clear context to screen reader users.

### **7.3.2. Theme Toggle Lacked Accessible State**
The theme toggle appeared visually functional, but assistive technologies had no way of knowing whether dark mode was on or off.

**Cause of the Issue:**
- Missing `aria-checked` attributes on the switch input.
- No dynamic update of state during interaction.

**How I Solved It:**  
In `theme.js`, I added JavaScript that updates the `aria-checked` state whenever the theme toggle is changed:

```javascript
themeSwitch.addEventListener("change", function () {
  const isLight = this.checked;
  this.setAttribute("aria-checked", isLight ? "true" : "false");
  applyTheme(isLight, true);
});
```
**Reference Materials:**  
- [Deque: Making Accessible Switches](https://www.deque.com/blog/making-accessible-switch/)
- [MDN: ARIA Switch Role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/switch_role)

**The Result:**  
Screen reader users are now clearly informed of the current theme state, with both visual and auditory feedback. 

### **7.3.3. Clear Cell Button Was Ambiguous**  
The "Clear Cell" button was represented by a visual X icon, but provided no verbal or semantic cue to screen readers.

**Cause of the Issue:**   
- Icon-only buttons lacked a descriptive label.
- Screen readers could not interpret the meaning of the icon.

**How I Solved It:**   
I added a clear `aria-label` and a hidden `<span>` to ensure screen readers announce its purpose:

```html
<h2 id="clear" aria-label="Clear Cell">
  <i class="fa-solid fa-delete-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  <span class="visuallyhidden">Clear</span>
</h2>
```
**Reference Materials:**  
- [MDN: ARIA Label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label)
- [W3C: Hiding Elements Accessibly](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/labels/#hiding-labels)

**The Result:**  
The button is now fully descriptive for assistive tech while remaining visually minimal.

### **7.4.4. Grid Cell Size Too Small for Touch Accessibility**

Initial grid cells were difficult to select on smaller screens due to insufficient size, violating mobile accessibility and usability guidelines‚Äîparticularly around recommended touch target areas.

**Cause of the Issue:**   
- Grid cell dimensions were fixed and too small to reliably tap on compact devices.
- The design did not account for minimum recommended touch area (48x48px as per WCAG and mobile usability best practices).

**How I Solved It:**   
I used CSS variables to control `--cell-size` and scaled them up responsively through media queries. This ensured that cells remained large enough to tap without zooming or mis-taps on most screen sizes.

```css
:root {
  --cell-size: 30px;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  :root {
    --cell-size: 60px;
  }
}
```
**Accessibility Consideration:**   
I consulted guidance from MDN and the W3C, which recommends maintaining a minimum target size of approximately 44‚Äì48 pixels. Only on the very smallest mobile screens was the cell size reduced below that threshold‚Äîand only to preserve layout integrity and prevent horizontal overflow. This was a deliberate trade-off, made only when absolutely necessary. 

**Reference Materials:**  
- [Accessibility for Products: Target touch size](https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/guides/mobile/target-touch-size/#:~:text=Content%20touch%20targets%20must%20be,to%20the%20smallest%20average%20finger.)
- [MDN: Using CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
- [W3C: Mobile Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#target-size)

**The Result:**  
Grid cells are now large enough for comfortable tapping on all but the smallest screens. On ultra-compact devices, layout remains intact, and users still retain full functionality with only minor compromises to spacing.

### **7.3.5. Lack of Initial Guidance on Page Load**
On first visit, users‚Äîespecially those relying on assistive technologies‚Äîwere unsure what to do. The game interface loaded silently without any prompt, leaving some users uncertain how to begin playing.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- There was no onboarding mechanism or setup flow.
- Users could begin interacting with the grid before selecting game settings, which could lead to confusion or accessibility conflicts.
- The page lacked any visual or semantic cue to indicate required first steps.

**How I Solved It:**  
This issue was initially highlighted during a feedback session with my mentor, who pointed out that requiring user input before accessing the game would guide all users more effectively‚Äîespecially screen reader users.

Based on this advice, I added logic to my `init.js` file that:

- Checks whether the puzzle grid has any existing content.
- If empty, triggers the setup modal automatically on page load.
- Uses Bootstrap‚Äôs modal configuration to make it non-dismissible (`backdrop: 'static'`, `keyboard: false`).
- Prevents interaction with the rest of the page until valid game settings are selected and submitted.
```javascript
const hasGridContent = $('#grid p').length > 0;
if (!hasGridContent) {
    const setupModalElement = document.getElementById("setup-modal");
    if (setupModalElement) {
        const setupModal = new bootstrap.Modal(setupModalElement, {
            backdrop: 'static',
            keyboard: false
        });
        setupModal.show();
        return;
    }
}
```
This ensured the modal opens automatically on load, users could not dismiss it via Escape key or background click. This meant focus could be trapped within the modal until submission and gameplay begins only after difficulty and timer are explicitly chosen.
**Reference Materials:**  
- [Bootstrap Modal Options](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/#static-backdrop)
- [MDN: Focus Management](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Keyboard-navigable_JavaScript_widgets)
- Mentor Guidance from [David Bowers](https://github.com/dnlbowers)

**The Result:**  
All users‚Äîvisual and non-visual‚Äînow receive immediate, guided onboarding upon page load. The structured setup flow improves clarity, prevents premature interaction, and ensures accessibility by making the first step clear, intentional, and accessible.

## **7.4. Performance Issues**
Performance was a critical focus throughout Codoku‚Äôs development, especially given its interactive nature, background media, and dynamic scripting. Slow load times, blocked interactivity, and visual lag were all potential risks particularly on lower-powered devices or slower connections. To ensure a smooth and responsive experience, I identified and resolved several performance-related issues through browser testing, dev tools profiling, mentor feedback, and research into modern frontend optimization strategies.

### **7.4.1. Heavy Background Assets**
Codoku‚Äôs modal and navbar backgrounds initially reused the same large `.webp` files as the full-page body backgrounds. While visually consistent, this introduced unnecessary weight in areas where smaller, more compressed assets would suffice particularly on mobile devices or slower connections. Unnecessarily large assets increase page load time. Even if the image is partially visible or cropped in a small container, the full file still needs to be downloaded and decoded by the browser, adding to the initial load time.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
Initially, the same `.webp` image assets were reused for both the body background and modal backgrounds. While this ensured visual consistency, it introduced unnecessary load time‚Äîespecially for modals where smaller images would suffice.

**How I Solved It:**    
I created dedicated, optimized `.webp` versions of background images specifically for modals. These modal-specific backgrounds were compressed further and resized to a maximum width of 1200px, reducing unnecessary pixel weight while preserving design quality.

**Reference Materials:**  
- [MDN: Responsive Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)
- [Google: WebP Image Format](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp)

**The Result:**  
Modal and navbar backgrounds now load significantly faster, with smaller image footprints reducing bandwidth usage. This improves performance across all devices, particularly on mobile and slower connections.

### **7.4.2. Scripts Blocked Interactivity**
JavaScript files delayed rendering and sluggish interactivity, especially on lower-end devices affecting the performance scores.

**Cause of the Issue:**   
- Scripts were loaded synchronously in the document `<head>`.
- Parsing and rendering were blocked until scripts finished executing.

**How I Solved It:**  
I moved all JavaScript `<script>` tags to the end of the `<body>` and added the `defer` attribute. This allowed the HTML to render first and prevented scripts from blocking the page.
```html
<!-- JavaScript Dependencies -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.7.1/dist/jquery.min.js" defer></script>

```
**Reference Materials:**  
- [MDN: Script Loading Strategies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-defer)

**The Result:**  
The time-to-interactive improved noticeably, with the UI becoming usable much sooner after page load.

### **7.4.5. Inefficient Image Sizing**  
Early versions of the About and 404 pages featured high-resolution `.webp` images that were visually appealing but far too large for their display context. This led to unnecessary bandwidth consumption and slower load times, especially on mobile devices or limited connections.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
These images were being served at full resolution even though they appeared at much smaller sizes within the layout. 
- `.webp` images were not resized or compressed to match their visible dimensions.
- `<img>` tags lacked explicit `width` and `height` attributes, preventing layout stability and efficient loading.
- No use of `srcset` or modern responsive image practices to tailor assets by device capability.

**How I Solved It:**  
I manually resized the About and 404 illustration images to match their maximum display size in the layout (generally under **400px width**). I retained the `.webp` format for compression and adjusted `width` and `height` attributes in the HTML for proper rendering.

To prevent layout shifts and optimize perceived load speed, I also:
- Added an explicit`height` on all `<img>` tags. 

**Reference Materials:**  
- [Google: WebP Image Format](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp)
- [Image Resizer](https://imageresizer.com/)

**The Result:**  
Images now load quickly without compromising clarity. Codoku‚Äôs About and 404 pages are noticeably faster and feel more responsive‚Äîespecially on mobile‚Äîthanks to lighter, correctly-sized visuals and proper layout rendering.

## **7.5. Validation Issues**
As part of Codoku‚Äôs commitment to clean, accessible, and standards-compliant code, I rigorously tested the application against HTML, ARIA, and accessibility validation tools (like the W3C Validator and axe DevTools). These tests surfaced several markup-level issues that, while not always visible to end users, posed risks to semantic clarity, screen reader compatibility, and long-term maintainability.

### **7.5.1. XHTML-Style Self-Closing Tags**
Codoku originally included self-closing tags like `<img />`, which are valid in XHTML but not in standard HTML5 syntax. While browsers are forgiving, these violations caused W3C validation errors.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- Habitual use of self-closing syntax (`<img />`) from older HTML/XHTML patterns.
- HTML5 expects `<img>` and similar void elements to be written without the trailing slash.

**How I Solved It:**  
I reviewed all void elements (`<img>`, `<input>`, etc.) and removed trailing slashes from their tags. This brought all templates in line with HTML5 standards.

**The Result:**  
The code now passes W3C validation cleanly, improving compatibility and technical correctness.

### **7.5.2. Invalid `height="auto"` in HTML**
Some image or element tags used inline HTML like `height="auto"`, which is not a valid value in standard HTML.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- Misuse of CSS-style properties within HTML attributes.
- Browsers ignored the invalid value, but validators flagged it as incorrect.

**How I Solved It:**  
I moved all visual sizing (like `height: auto`) from inline HTML to the external CSS file (`style.css`). This not only resolved the error but also improved separation of concerns between content and presentation. This was later changed upon reviewing image performances, see [7.4.5. Inefficient Image Sizing](#745-inefficient-image-sizing). 

**The Result:**  
All layout and scaling now conform to HTML/CSS best practices, ensuring smooth rendering and valid markup.

### **7.5.3. Duplicate IDs in Modals**  
During development, reusable modal templates (especially for alerts and game completion) introduced duplicate `id` attributes, which broke the uniqueness requirement of the DOM.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- Static `id` values were repeated in dynamically loaded or reused HTML components.
- This risked unexpected behavior when referencing modals with JavaScript or accessibility tools.

**How I Solved It:**  
I scoped all modal related IDs more carefully and added conditional logic in the JavaScript to append unique suffixes where necessary (e.g. `-hinted`, `-congrats`, `-alert`).

**The Result:**  
Each element now has a unique ID, resolving validation issues and avoiding conflicts during DOM interaction.

### **7.5.4. Redundant ARIA Roles**  
Some semantic HTML elements like `<button>` and `<nav>` were given explicit ARIA roles (e.g. `role="button"`), which are already implied by their tag type.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- Overuse of ARIA roles in an attempt to ensure accessibility.
- Misunderstanding of when native elements already convey necessary semantics.

**How I Solved It:**  
I removed redundant `role` attributes from semantic elements where the role was implicit. This included roles on `<button>`, `<header>`, and `<nav>` tags.

**The Result:**  
The markup is now cleaner, easier to read, and conforms to WAI-ARIA best practices without duplication. 

## **7.6. Unresolved Issues**
Despite extensive testing and iteration, a few issues remain in the current Codoku build. These were either deemed low-impact or out of scope for this project‚Äôs goals. However, they have been documented here for transparency and potential future enhancement.

### **7.6.1. Grid Keyboard Navigation**
While Codoku supports mouse and touch input well, keyboard users‚Äîparticularly those relying on assistive technologies‚Äîcannot currently navigate the Sudoku grid using arrow keys or tab focus. This limits accessibility for non-pointer users.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- The grid is constructed using `<p>` tags instead of native form elements or semantic table structures.  
- Paragraphs are not focusable by default and don‚Äôt support directional keyboard interaction.  
- Grid items lack semantic roles like `grid`, `cell`, and `row`.

**Attempts Made:**  
- Tried adding `tabindex` to each cell for manual focusability.  
- Experimented with JavaScript-based focus control and roving `tabindex`.  
- Considered adding ARIA roles (e.g., `role="gridcell"`), but found limited browser support without full semantic structure.

**Why It Remains Unresolved:**  
- A robust keyboard implementation would require a complete rebuild of the grid using a `<table>` or fully custom component structure with accessible keyboard handling and focus management.  
- This was outside the scope of this manually coded, design-first prototype.

**Impact:**  
- Not critical to core functionality; mouse and touch users can fully interact.  
- However, a future version should prioritize keyboard accessibility to meet full WCAG compliance.

### **7.6.2. JavaScript Minification**
All JavaScript files in Codoku are served in unminified form. While easy to read and debug, this results in slightly larger file sizes and longer load times.

**Cause of the Issue:**  
- Code was written for manual understanding, educational clarity, and ease of debugging.  
- Production-focused tools like Webpack or Terser were intentionally not used.

**Attempts Made:**  
- Considered adding a build pipeline with Webpack or using Terser via npm.  
- Explored browser-based minifiers, but avoided altering file structure.

**Why It Remains Unresolved:**  
- The project scope emphasized transparency and modular file organization over optimization.  
- Adding build tooling would conflict with the manual-first, no-framework project goals.

**Impact:**  
- Slightly longer load and parse times (only measurable on low-end devices or slow networks).  
- No functional degradation‚Äîintentional and acceptable tradeoff for this project phase.

## **8. Deployment**  
The **Codoku** project was deployed using GitHub Pages, allowing the live version of the site to be accessed directly through a browser without the need for additional server configuration.

To publish the site via GitHub Pages, I followed these steps:

1. Navigated to the GitHub repository for the Codoku project.
2. Clicked on the Settings tab at the top of the repository.
3. In the left-hand sidebar, I selected the Pages section.
4. Under the Source dropdown menu:
   - I chose the `main` branch as the publishing source.
   - I selected the `/ (root)` folder as the deployment directory.
   - I then clicked Save.
5. GitHub automatically generated a public URL for the live site, which appeared as a success banner.

The deployed site is now live and accessible at:[https://teseolou.github.io/codoku/](https://teseolou.github.io/codoku/)

Additionally, I will fork this repository so that it can be cloned for future use and development.

# 9. Future Developments
While the current version of **Codoku** is fully functional, responsive, and accessible, several enhancements are planned for future releases. These improvements aim to build upon the strong foundation established during development and address performance optimizations, accessibility refinements, and extended functionality.

## **9.1 Accessibility Improvements**
Codoku prioritizes accessibility, but several enhancements remain to support full keyboard control and screen reader interaction. These changes will help ensure a more inclusive experience for users with diverse needs.

### **9.1.1 Grid Cell Keyboard Navigation**
- **Issue**: Currently, users must use a mouse or touchscreen to select grid cells; full keyboard-only gameplay isn‚Äôt supported.
- **Cause**: The grid uses `<p>` elements, which are not focusable by default.
- **Barrier**: True keyboard navigation would require restructuring the grid using `<button>` or `<input>` elements or implementing a roving `tabindex` system with ARIA labels.
- **Status**: This was scoped out for this version due to time constraints and complexity but is a priority for future accessibility enhancements.

### **9.1.2 Improved Screen Reader Support**
- **Observation**: Although modals and toggles are announced properly, screen reader users cannot currently interact with or understand the state of the Sudoku grid itself.
- **Plan**: Restructure the grid with semantic roles, possibly using ARIA `grid`, `row`, and `cell` roles or a native HTML `<table>` structure to support narrated navigation.
- **Goal**: Ensure screen reader users receive meaningful cues while moving across the grid and entering values.

## **9.2 JavaScript Optimization**
To improve loading time and production efficiency, Codoku will eventually move toward minified and modular JavaScript. This ensures maintainability during development while enabling performance improvements for deployment.

### **9.2.1 Unminified JavaScript Files**
- **Context**: Lighthouse flagged JavaScript files as unminified.
- **Reason**: Code was intentionally left readable and commented for learning and assessment.
- **Planned**: Introduce minification via Terser or integrate a build process using Webpack or Parcel to optimize delivery for production use.

## **9.3 Performance Enhancements**
Performance tuning is a key focus for future iterations. Planned improvements include stripping unused styles and optimizing visual content to ensure smoother gameplay, especially on mobile devices.

### **9.3.1 Purging Unused CSS**
- **Issue**: Bootstrap and Font Awesome include many unused styles, increasing CSS payload size.
- **Future Strategy**:
  - Use **PurgeCSS** to strip unused selectors in production builds.
  - Consider creating a **custom Bootstrap build** limited to Codoku's required components.

### **9.3.2 LCP Optimization (Largest Contentful Paint)**
- **Observation**: Large `.webp` assets, especially modal and page backgrounds, can slightly delay LCP performance on mobile devices.
- **Future Plan**: Experiment with further compression tools and consider lazy loading or image swapping based on screen resolution.

## **9.4 Feature Extensions**
A number of planned gameplay and interface enhancements will deepen player engagement and improve overall UX, including progress tracking, persistent score storage, and offline support.

### **9.4.1 Backend Integration for Score Saving**
- **Goal**: Allow users to save their game progress or submit scores.
- **Future Tools**:
  - Use Firebase or Supabase for real-time databases.
  - Build a REST API using Node.js and Express for authentication and data storage.

### **9.4.2 Enhanced Visual Feedback for Clues and Errors**
- **Current Limitation**: Feedback for hints and incorrect answers relies on color alone (green/red).
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Add semantic icons or symbols
  - Include screen reader alerts via ARIA live regions
  - Use patterns or outlines to distinguish hint and error states

### **9.4.3 Progress Bar for Game Completion**
- **Planned Feature**: Add a visual progress bar showing how much of the puzzle is complete.
- **Benefits**: Gives real-time feedback, helps motivate players, and supports cognitive accessibility.
- **Approach**: Track filled cells vs total editable cells and update the bar dynamically using Bootstrap or custom styling.

### **9.4.4 Offline Play Support**
- **Goal**: Allow Codoku to function without an internet connection.
- **Cause**: Currently, all assets load from the network and are not cached for offline use.
- **Planned Solution**:
  - Implement a service worker to cache HTML, CSS, JS, and assets.
  - Add a manifest file to support installability and offline behavior.
- **Barrier**: Offline support would require significant JavaScript changes and testing workflows, which are currently beyond the scope of this project.
- **Future Plan**: Investigate using Workbox in a future module and progressively enhance the site toward full PWA support.
