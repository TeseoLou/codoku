## 2.3. Structure

The Structure Plane in User Experience (UX) design addresses how Codoku‚Äôs features, content, and interactions are logically arranged and experienced by users. It serves as the bridge between Codoku‚Äôs strategic aims and the interface‚Äôs visual design, ensuring that players not only understand how to navigate the application but also feel comfortable doing so‚Äîregardless of their age, ability, or device.

Structure in Codoku focuses heavily on interaction design and usability. Because it‚Äôs a game-based application rather than a content-driven site, special attention was paid to how players interact with core features such as the Sudoku grid, number inputs, validation buttons, and timers. This meant designing a layout that minimized distraction, kept functional elements within easy reach (especially on touchscreens), and presented clear, real-time feedback throughout the puzzle-solving process.

Navigation design, though more lightweight than in multi-page websites, still plays a crucial role in Codoku. Key areas like the Home screen, About page, and Rules section are accessible through a clean top-level navigation bar, ensuring users can easily locate supporting information without leaving the game environment. Footer links also maintain consistency and provide access to external resources such as GitHub and a charitable donation page.

Interaction design was driven by the need for clarity and feedback. The structure includes:
- A clearly defined Sudoku grid area with interactive cells
- Button-based number inputs for users on touch or mouse devices
- Difficulty and timer selectors to personalize gameplay
- Clue and validation buttons to assist with progress and learning
- Visual indicators and pop-ups for errors, completion, or timeouts

Information architecture was simplified to reduce cognitive load. Rather than relying on dense menus or excessive interface elements, Codoku‚Äôs structure uses semantic HTML and ARIA labels to guide screen readers and assistive technology. Elements are grouped meaningfully by function (e.g., controls, display, instructions), and consistent layout patterns help users build familiarity over time.

Accessibility and responsive structure were also vital. Whether users access Codoku from a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the interface adapts fluidly, maintaining usability. High-contrast modes, readable font sizes, and keyboard navigability were key design principles supporting inclusive access.

Ultimately, Codoku‚Äôs structure was crafted not only to guide users through the app, but to create a calm, supportive environment that enhances focus, supports experimentation, and rewards logical thinking. This alignment between interaction, layout, and accessibility ensures a fluid experience for first-time players, repeat puzzlers, and lifelong learners alike.
