- üü• **Must-Have** ‚Üí Essential for gameplay and accessibility  
- üü® **Should-Have** ‚Üí Valuable enhancements, not vital for MVP  
- üü© **Could-Have** ‚Üí Nice-to-have features for future development

These core features served as a structured development blueprint, ensuring Codoku's MVP delivered essential gameplay, accessibility, and visual consistency‚Äîwhile leaving room for feature growth in future iterations.

## **2.3. Structure**

The Structure Plane defines how Codoku‚Äôs content, features, and interactions are arranged to support ease of use and logical flow. It connects strategic goals with the interface‚Äôs layout, ensuring that players‚Äîregardless of age, ability, or device‚Äîcan navigate and play comfortably.

As a game-based application, Codoku prioritizes interaction design over dense content. Key features like the grid, number inputs, validation tools, and timers are placed for intuitive access, with real-time feedback to reduce frustration and aid progression.

Navigation remains simple but purposeful. A top nav bar provides quick access to the Home, About, and Rules pages, while the footer offers consistent links to external platforms like GitHub and the donation page.

The layout includes:
- An interactive Sudoku grid
- Touch/mouse-friendly number buttons
- Difficulty and timer selectors
- Clue and check buttons
- Feedback messages and modals

Information is structured to minimize distractions and cognitive load, with semantic HTML and ARIA support for screen readers. Elements are grouped by function and follow consistent patterns to support user familiarity.

Codoku‚Äôs responsive structure adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile, using scalable fonts, high-contrast visuals, and keyboard-friendly controls. Altogether, this creates an inclusive, focused space that enhances logic-based engagement and replayability.

### **2.3.1 MoSCoW Prioritization**

Throughout the project, effective prioritization according to business goals, user needs, and developer capabilities was crucial. With the project scoped to deliver a complete, accessible Sudoku game interface within a limited timeframe, it became essential to continually assess what was realistic and achievable based on available time, technical complexity, and learning goals.

To support this, the **MoSCoW** prioritization framework was used to categorize tasks into **Must-Have**, **Should-Have**, **Could-Have**, and eventually, **Won‚Äôt-Have**. This final category emerged as development progressed and certain features though potentially valuable proved too complex, time-intensive, or peripheral for the scope of a front-end milestone project.

Features marked as **Won‚Äôt-Have** were not removed from consideration altogether, but rather postponed for a future iteration or stretch project once more time and experience could be dedicated to their successful implementation. Below is a summary of the features assigned to this category and the rationale for each decision:

| üü¶ Feature               | Reason for Won‚Äôt-Have Status                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scoreboard**           | Requires data persistence and local storage logic that proved difficult to implement in time. |
| **Save Game**            | Though planned, saving and restoring puzzle state (including grid, timer, clues) required more advanced JavaScript than currently manageable. |
| **Print Puzzle Button**  | Would require custom print styling and puzzle state management, which was deprioritized to focus on core interactivity. |
| **Multimedia Instructions** | Recording, editing, and embedding accessible audio/video content exceeded the available development time and required tools outside the project scope. |

These decisions helped ensure that core interactive and accessible features were delivered to a high standard, while leaving the door open for future improvements and enhancements.

### **2.3.2 Site Hierarchy**

Site hierarchy refers to how Codoku‚Äôs content, features, and pages are logically organized and accessed by users. It shapes the user‚Äôs journey through the application, affecting clarity, efficiency, and accessibility. For a game-based web app like Codoku, hierarchy needed to support both discovery and flow, prioritizing gameplay while offering seamless access to supporting features like instructions and about information.

**Aims of Codoku's Site Structure**

- üè† Make core gameplay immediately accessible with minimal clicks  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Guide users through setup before play (difficulty and timer)  
- ‚ûï Support learning and accessibility with modals and structured layout  

Codoku is structured around a single-page core gameplay interface, with supplemental navigation to an About page and modal overlays that support the user without removing them from the experience. Functional elements such as the Setup Modal, Rules Modal, and Completion Feedback act as focused UI components that enhance clarity while keeping the player in flow.

| Page / Modal          | Function                                             | Role in UX Journey           |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Home (Game)**    | Primary interface for Sudoku gameplay                | üéÆ Start, Play, Progress     |
| **Setup Modal**       | Appears before game begins, lets user pick difficulty & timer | ‚öôÔ∏è Customization & Onboarding |
| **Rules Modal**       | On-demand gameplay instructions                      | üßæ Learn & Assist            |
| **About Page**        | Project background and donation information          | üëã Context & Mission         |
| **404 Error Page**    | Redirect users who hit an incorrect route            | ‚ö†Ô∏è Recovery & Redirection    |
| **Completion Modal**  | Feedback, stats, and new game options post-solve     | üèÜ Success & Replay          |

The structure of the Codoku site hierarchy is intentionally designed as a pyramid, placing the most essential user-facing elements at the top and progressively layering supportive or contextual features beneath.

![Codoku Site Hierarchy Pyramid](docs/figures/charts/site-pyramid.webp)  
*A pyramid diagram showing the importance and relationship between the main interface, modals, and support pages in Codoku.*

**Game**  
At the top of the hierarchy is the game itself ‚Äî the Sudoku grid, number inputs, timer, and validation. It is the core experience, drawing immediate focus and requiring an uncluttered, accessible layout.

**Pre-Game Modals**  
These appear before gameplay begins.  
- **Setup** lets users choose difficulty and timer options.  
- **Rules** explains how to play.  
They enhance onboarding and accessibility while staying separate from the main grid.

**Post-Game Modal**  
Triggered after a puzzle is solved.  
- Gives success feedback and stats.  
- Offers options to start a new game or admire the board.  
It supports user motivation and replay.

**Supplementary Pages**  
Supportive but non-core. These are accessed less frequently but strengthen the experience.

- **About** shares project purpose and links to donations.  
- **Error** (404) redirects users from broken links.  

![Codoku User Flow](docs/figures/charts/user-flow.webp)

   - Positioned outside the main flow, the error page is triggered when users navigate to an invalid or broken route.  
   - Acts as a safeguard across the entire site by redirecting users back to a valid entry point like the Home/Game page.  
   - Enhances accessibility and trust by ensuring all interactions result in a usable path forward.

This structure helps players remain focused on solving puzzles while providing fallback mechanisms and optional exploration without breaking flow or causing confusion.

### **2.3.4 Navigation**

Effective navigation was essential to Codoku‚Äôs user experience (UX) design, ensuring users could move confidently between gameplay and supporting content without unnecessary complexity. Because Codoku is a game-first web app, navigation needed to feel lightweight, accessible, and non-disruptive, guiding users through core game actions while offering easy access to help, context, and redirection when needed.

Codoku‚Äôs navigation follows best practices in clarity, predictability, and responsiveness:

- **Predictability**: Users know where buttons and links will take them.
- **Efficiency**: Core actions like starting a puzzle or checking the rules are one click away.
- **Guidance**: Navigation encourages a clear journey from setup to gameplay and beyond.

The navbar appears persistently across pages and includes quick access to:

üìå **Home**: Puzzle interface and game logic  
üìå **Rules**: Modal with instructions for new users  
üìå **About**: Purpose of the project and donation link  

This ensures users are never far from core functions, while modals and page transitions are used to maintain focus and flow within the single-page app experience.

While gameplay is central, Codoku also includes utility pages and overlays:

‚öôÔ∏è **Setup Modal** ‚Äî Opens at launch, allowing users to select difficulty and timer options.  
üßæ **Rules Modal** ‚Äî Available on demand for help.  
üèÜ **Completion Modal** ‚Äî Triggered when the puzzle is solved, showing stats and restart options.  
‚ùå **404 Error Page** ‚Äî Loads when a broken or invalid URL is visited, offering return-to-home navigation.  

These elements are not listed in the main navbar, but play key roles in usability and player flow.

External navigation is minimal, but still present:

üíù **Donation Link** ‚Äì Found in the About page, linking to a trusted cognitive health charity.  
üîó **Social Media Links** ‚Äì Displayed in the site footer for sharing and project visibility (e.g., GitHub, LinkedIn).  

These external links open in new tabs to ensure users remain anchored in the Codoku experience.

![Codoku Site Map Diagram](docs/figures/charts/nav-map.webp)
_A navigation map of Codoku showing flow from the Game Page to supporting modals, About, and Error pages, with external links branching consistently._

The diagram illustrates Codoku's navigation ecosystem, capturing both user-directed flows (via navbars and buttons) and automated fallbacks (like error recovery). The structure is built around three main nodes: Game, About, and Error, with consistent access to modals and external links across all routes.

#### üéÆ **Game Page (Central Hub)**
Game is the core of the user journey and central interaction point.
- The navbar allows users to move between:
  - Pages 
  - Rules modal
- Users can also navigate to:
  - New to reset/start a new puzzle.
  - Complete (Completion Modal) when the puzzle is solved.
- The footer provides access to socials links:
  - Facebook
  - Instagram
  - Twitter

This path keeps essential puzzle actions just one step away, allowing users to stay engaged while still accessing help or restarting as needed.

It's accessible from anywhere via broken links or redirects.

### **2.3.4 User Interaction (UI)**

Interaction design in Codoku played a central role in shaping how users engaged with the interface, particularly given the puzzle-focused nature of the project. The aim was to create a game environment that felt intuitive, responsive, and rewarding across devices and skill levels.

Rather than designing for content browsing or form submission (as in more traditional sites), Codoku‚Äôs UI focused on player interaction with game elements such as the Sudoku the grid, difficulty selector, feedback modals, and control buttons. Every element was implemented with usability, responsiveness, and feedback in mind.

Codoku‚Äôs interaction model followed front-end best practices:

‚≠ê Ensured smooth, predictable input handling across keyboard, mouse, and touch devices  
‚≠ê Provided real-time feedback through color changes, pop-ups, and sounds  
‚≠ê Used modals instead of separate pages to keep gameplay immersive  
‚≠ê Maintained consistent navigation elements (navbar and footer) for orientation  
‚≠ê Applied hover/focus states to buttons and grid cells for improved accessibility  
‚≠ê Focused on mobile-first responsiveness and performance

## **2.4 Skeleton**

The Skeleton Plane for **Codoku** translates the conceptual structure of the site into a tangible, interactive layout that users can navigate with ease. While the Structure Plane established how key components such as gameplay, guidance, and content were organized, the Skeleton Plane focused on refining the placement, flow, and usability of those elements within the browser viewport.

At this stage, interface interactions were visually defined, ensuring that the user journey from puzzle setup to completion felt seamless, intuitive, and consistent across all devices.

This addressed three main areas of user experience:

1. **Interface Design**: Focuses on arranging buttons, controls, images, and other interactive components to make navigation simple and intuitive for users.
2. **Information Design**: Structures content in a clear, accessible, and well-organized format to support readability and logical flow.
3. **Responsiveness**: Ensures layouts and interactive features automatically adjust to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, or mobile) for a smooth and consistent user experience.

### **2.4.1 Navigation Design**

A clear and consistent navigation system was essential in Codoku to support both ease of use and player engagement. While the Structure Plane defined the relationships between pages and content areas, the Skeleton Plane transformed that framework into an interactive visual system guiding users across gameplay and support areas.

#### **2.4.1.a Navbar**

The **main navbar** remained visible at the top of every page.

![Wireframe of Codoku navigation bar](docs/figures/wireframes/navbar.webp)

üèÜ **Completion Modal**: Triggers after puzzle completion, providing options to start a new game or review the solved grid with 'Admire' and 'New' respectively.

These modals were focus-trappable, styled for contrast, and screen-reader friendly.

#### **2.4.1.e Alerts**

Feedback mechanisms played a critical role in guiding and informing users during gameplay. Codoku incorporated several alert types.

![Codoku Alert Modals](docs/figures/wireframes/alerts.webp)
*Wireframes of Codoku‚Äôs alert pop-ups. From left to right: Navigation alert, error alert, timeout alert.*

‚ö†Ô∏è **Navigation Alert**: Appears when user presses 'About' in navbar while on homepage. 'OK' proceeds user to next page and 'Cancel' calls off the navigation.   
‚è∞ **Timeout Alert**: Appears when the timer reaches zero and displays a message with option to try again  
üîé **Incorrect Puzzle Alert**: Notifies users when they submit a grid that is fully filled but contains errors. 'OK' returns user to puzzle.

These alerts were designed to provide non-intrusive, multi-sensory feedback that enhanced usability without overwhelming the user.

The navigation design followed UX best practices, focusing on:

- **Clarity & Simplicity**: Only essential items were placed in the navbar to reduce cognitive load during gameplay.  
- **Persistent Access**: Both the navigation bar and footer remained fixed across pages for easy access.  
- **Predictable Flow**: Users could navigate from the game to support content (e.g., rules or about) without disrupting progress.

### **2.4.2 Interface & Information Design**

Codoku‚Äôs interface and information design were shaped by a mobile-first approach, ensuring that the application was intuitive, accessible, and visually coherent on smaller screens before scaling up to desktops. Given that many users engage with puzzles via mobile devices, the site was optimized for vertical flow, touch-friendly inputs, and minimal distraction.

Interface Design focused on how users interact with elements such as the grid, number keys, buttons, and modals. Components were spaced for easy tapping and logically placed to maintain focus on gameplay.

Information Design guided how content was structured and displayed. Readability, visual hierarchy, and grouping were used to deliver instructions, game stats, and support content in a smooth, non-intrusive format. 

#### üéÆ **2.4.2.a Game Page**

The Game Page is the central hub and default landing view for Codoku. It prioritizes functionality and minimalism.

## 2.4.5. Responsiveness

Responsive design is essential to Codoku‚Äôs usability and success. As a logic-based puzzle app, Codoku prioritizes interaction and accessibility across all devices‚Äîespecially smartphones and tablets, where users often play on the go. A mobile-first approach ensures smooth gameplay, adaptable layouts, and a consistent interface regardless of screen size.

Responsive Design Principles Applied in Codoku:
- **Mobile-First Development:** Layouts are designed first for small screens to ensure accessibility on mobile. Touch-friendly interactions are prioritized from the start.
- **Flexible Layouts:** CSS Grid and Flexbox allow UI components like the grid, number keys, and buttons to rearrange themselves based on screen size.
- **Media Queries:** Responsive breakpoints allow seamless transitions between mobile, tablet, and desktop views while preserving structure.
- **Optimized Navigation:** A collapsible hamburger menu is used on smaller screens, and fixed nav/footer bars help with orientation.
- **Accessibility:** All buttons are comfortably spaced, font sizes scale with viewport changes, and icons remain easily tappable across devices.

Codoku takes advantage of Bootstrap 5 to manage layout responsiveness. The framework's default breakpoints help scale content across viewports:

| Breakpoint | Label     | Range              | Example Device        |
|------------|-----------|--------------------|------------------------|
| `xs`       | Extra Small | `<576px`          | Small phones           |
| `sm`       | Small      | `‚â•576px`           | Larger phones          |
| `md`       | Medium     | `‚â•768px`           | Tablets                |
| `lg`       | Large      | `‚â•992px`           | Laptops                |
| `xl`       | Extra Large| `‚â•1200px`          | Desktops               |
| `xxl`      | XXL        | `‚â•1400px`          | Large desktops         |

Codoku‚Äôs design targets the `sm` breakpoints first, gradually enhancing layout and content presentation for `md`, `lg`, and `xl` screens.

#### **2.4.5.a. Game Page Responsiveness**

![Codoku Game Page Responsive Layouts](docs/figures/wireframes/responsiveness-game.webp)  
*Responsive wireframes of the Codoku game page across mobile, tablet, and desktop.*

- **Tablet & Desktop:** Larger and more generous spacing for buttons and texted improved clarity and reduced user frustration.

The Codoku site follows current responsive design best practices, ensuring that all interactions‚Äîfrom tapping a clue button to navigating the rules‚Äîare fluid, intuitive, and accessible.

## **2.5 Surface**

The **Surface Plane** represents the final layer of Codoku‚Äôs UX process‚Äîwhere layout, functionality, and interaction meet a cohesive and refined visual design. While previous stages focused on how the application worked and guided users through content and interactions, the surface focuses on how everything *looks* and *feels*.

For **Codoku**, the surface wasn‚Äôt simply about styling‚Äîit was about creating an accessible, calming, and logic-focused environment that supports player focus and cognitive engagement. Since Sudoku is an activity grounded in mental clarity, Codoku‚Äôs interface was designed to be free from distraction while reinforcing thoughtful play.

Rather than adopting complex patterns or overly decorative elements, Codoku‚Äôs aesthetic was intentionally minimal, intuitive, and built around:

- Neutral Color Palette  
- Functional Typography  
- Grid-Driven Layout  
- Familiarity & Ergonomics 

Principles That Guided the Surface Design

| Principle            | Application in Codoku                                   |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Visual Hierarchy** | Clear typography and spacing prioritize gameplay actions (e.g., New, Check, Clue buttons). |
| **Consistency**      | Repeated layout rules and component styling across modals, buttons, and navigation. |
| **Accessibility**    | High contrast text, large interactive elements, and keyboard/touch compatibility. |
| **Minimal Distraction** | Simple backgrounds and generous white space allow users to focus solely on solving the puzzle. |
| **Subtle Feedback**  | Light hover animations, sound cues, and modals guide without overwhelming. |

Codoku‚Äôs surface design complements its purpose: 
- foster logical thinking
- encourage user flow
- create an environment that feels both intelligent and approachable

Every interface decision was filtered through a lens of simplicity and user empathy so that nothing distracts from what really matters... the puzzle.

### 2.5.1 **Branding and Aesthetic**

Codoku‚Äôs surface design draws inspiration from the clean, logic-focused visuals seen in traditional puzzle spreads‚Äîsuch as those found in newspapers and printed puzzle books.

![Newspaper puzzle spread reference](docs/figures/images/newspaper-puzzle-page.webp)  
*Reference image showing traditional print puzzles like Sudoku, Codeword, and Kakuro.*

Where many puzzle apps adopt vibrant colors and gamified styles, Codoku takes a calmer, print-inspired approach. The aim is to provide a focused and thoughtful experience that evokes the feeling of solving puzzles in a newspaper or logic book.

**üîò Minimalism**  
  Inspired by black-and-white puzzle spreads, Codoku uses a clean layout with minimal distractions to support extended concentration.

**üß© Puzzle-First Layout**  
  The Sudoku grid remains the visual and functional centerpiece. Buttons, stats, and UI elements are designed to support‚Äînot compete with‚Äîit.

**üé® Monochrome-Inspired Theme**  
  The light and dark modes avoid oversaturation, echoing grayscale design patterns found in print logic puzzles.

**üóûÔ∏è Print-to-Digital Aesthetic**  
  Codoku brings the tactile familiarity of paper puzzles into the digital age, with responsive layouts and screen-friendly enhancements.

The result is an interface that feels focused, timeless, and cognitively engaging. Codoku‚Äôs visual identity is simple yet meaningful‚Äîdesigned for thinkers, logic lovers, and lifelong puzzlers across all devices.

>_Inspired by the pages we‚Äôve been puzzling, poring and pencilling over for decades. Codoku puts the print tradition in your pocket._
